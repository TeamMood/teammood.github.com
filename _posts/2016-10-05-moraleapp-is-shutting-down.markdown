On October 5th 2016, [MoraleApp](https://moraleapp.com/) announced that they are shutting down their service.

That's a sad news for their users that have to look for an alternative but also for TeamMood who lose a pretty great competitor.

Anyway, TeamMood has worked hard and it is now possible to migrate from MoraleApp to TeamMood seamlessly, without loosing your historical data.

If you want to import your MoraleApp data into TeamMood, just [contact us](mailto:support@teammood.com).
