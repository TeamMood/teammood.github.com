It's been a while since I wanted to build a project of my own. On a daily basis, I give advices to IT companies about technologies, methodologies and strategies to build awesome products. And now it is my turn !

So I finally took the time to build my first side project: <a href="http://teammood.com" class="teammood">TeamMood</a> !

I will not explain what the project is about in this post, I prefer to let you discover the idea through the very first MVP which is a simple "[coming soon](http://teammood.com)" page and let you give me a lot of [feedback](mailto:hello@teammood.com).

Basically, the idea scratched me since many months because I feel that it can bring a lot in some companies that I work with. But it took me a lot of time before starting to build something, probably because I thought that if I begin to do this, I'd have to pull it to the end, ie some kind of commitment.

And yes, I use LeanStartup to explore the idea, because I don't know if it will be a good one and if people will be interested. So let's learn with this first MVP and we'll see :-)
