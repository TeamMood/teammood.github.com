        <title>How to Reduce Stress at Work: 12 Strategies to Handle Stressful Careers</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/08/28/how-to-reduce-stress-at-work-12-strategies-to-handle-stressful-careers.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/08/28/how-to-reduce-stress-at-work-12-strategies-to-handle-stressful-careers.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed. Nervous. Exhausted. Agitated. Pained. All at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, if you’re like, well, pretty much every worker ever, you know what we’re talking about: stress. No matter your job, work stress is like the zero on a roulette wheel: it’s coming around eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, as a species we’ve developed a host of strategies — large and small — for managing stress. We’re going to share 12 with you. Why 12? Because it’s the least stressful number, of course!*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note: scientific backing for this may be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biggies-sleep-eat-right-exercise&quot;&gt;1. The Biggies: Sleep, Eat right, Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’ve heard these all before. Too bad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/sleep.aspx&quot;&gt;Scientific study after scientific study&lt;/a&gt; has validated the effectiveness of all these things for relieving stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping, eating right, and exercising are all great for your physical health, but more importantly, they also do wonders for psychological health. All three help boost endorphins, regulate dopamine, and simply keep you happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t mean you can’t cheat. (Because sometimes the best stress relief is binge-watching Game of Thrones with a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.) But if you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualspeech.com/blog/managing-anxiety-stress-workplace&quot;&gt;manage the stress&lt;/a&gt; you already have while simultaneously helping bullet-proof yourself from stress in the future, you owe it to yourself to start thinking about all these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;establish-boundaries&quot;&gt;2. Establish Boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the source of work stress is the feeling that work can never end. That feeling’s certainly grown as electronic communication ensures you can always be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it? Sometimes the best stress-prevention technique is to work on saying no. No emails after 9pm. No work on the weekends. No letting managers add more work to your already-too-full plate. You don’t have to choose all of these, but you should choose the one or two that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-interruptions&quot;&gt;3. Reduce Interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies prove it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html&quot;&gt;interruptions&lt;/a&gt; make us more agitated. That’s why one good strategy is to keep interruptions to a minimum. Turn off your internet connection for a while. Or at least close your email reader and chat windows. Put a “do not disturb” sign on your door or cubicle. Wear big headphones so that people know not to bother you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get more done and won’t feel pulled in a million directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-things-down&quot;&gt;4. Write Things Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much going on in your head? Use an old technology to help: pencil and paper. When you’re stressed out because you have too much to keep track of, take a sheet of paper and write down everything you have to do. (Or use an app like RTM, or Trello.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having to worry about remembering what you have to do frees up a surprising amount of emotional energy to actually do those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritize-to-immediately-reduce-work-stress&quot;&gt;5. Prioritize to Immediately Reduce Work Stress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it feels like you’ll just never get everything done, sometimes you just need to realize that you don’t have to. Make a list of all the tasks on your plate, then decide what really has to get done, and what you’d just like to have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that what you’d like to get done isn’t important. But you can worry about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up-your-desk-or-workspace&quot;&gt;6. Clean up Your Desk or Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, studies show that a cluttered desk helps raise work stress levels. Often when everything else feels unruly, taking 30 minutes to organize your workspace can bring a relieving feeling of calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/oCGjUWkj8vz9u&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: this same strategy applies to your apartment, your house, your car, your briefcase, or any other place you keep your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-up-early&quot;&gt;7. Show up Early&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stressed because you’re always running behind schedule, what can do the trick is coming to work 10 minutes early every day. Get some coffee, put your stuff away, and plan out your day. By the time “worktime” hits, you’re already rolling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listen-to-music&quot;&gt;8. Listen to Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Congreve wrote that “Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast.” He’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/l0MYEpCzZTQqdQSju&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a little de-stressing at work, throw on the headphones and dial up whatever tunes make you happy. Beyonce? Bach? 2-Pac? Doesn’t really matter — if you’re digging it, you’re feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;schedule-in-breaks&quot;&gt;9. Schedule in Breaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to feel like the only way to manage a stressful workload is to power through it, non-stop. Turns out that’s actually counter-productive. It’s a fact: breaks let you get more done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about all the work you have to do, set breaks for yourself. Work hard for 25 minutes, then walk around for 10. Work hard for another 25 minutes, then read something stupid online. Give yourself time to recharge; it’ll keep you from burning yourself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it is time to take a vacation, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clicktime.com/time-off-management&quot;&gt;schedule time off&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy some much-needed R&amp;amp;R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eliminate-unnecessary-meetings&quot;&gt;10. Eliminate Unnecessary Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is falls more into “larger strategies” than “things to do right now.” That said, at plenty of workplaces, meetings pile on until there’s no time to simply sit down and work. That’s stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you are on the totem pole, you’ll be helping everyone else on your team if you advocate for dropping unnecessary meetings. There’ll be fewer things to worry about, and you’ll free up more time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reward-yourself-for-working&quot;&gt;11. Reward Yourself for Working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best cure for stress is to simply be nice to yourself. And what better reason is there to be nice to yourself than for having done some good work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with breaks (see #9 above), small rewards can be a great way to keep yourself productive, while helping you tally the amount of work you’ve actually gotten done. So work hard for a while, then reward yourself by writing to a friend. Or having a small treat. Or leaving the office for 10 minutes. By holding those rewards back until you’ve earned them, you’ll be more motivated to work. But by giving them to yourself, you’ll tell yourself you deserve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-thankful&quot;&gt;12. Be Thankful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silly as it might sound, cultivating a thankful attitude can reduce both general and work stress, and make you happier. As a general life practice, working to be more thankful is one of the best ways to keep you stress-free (or at least stress-reduced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/26gsjCZpPolPr3sBy&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to do this. Keep a gratitude journal. Force yourself to say “thank you” to three people a day. Spend 5 minutes every night going over what you’re thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever of these you choose, keep doing it. In a short period of time, you’ll notice how much better you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evaluating Your Team’s Health With the Niko-Niko Calendar</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Would you go out of your house with a rain coat if it wasn’t for the weather forecast to warn you of the rain coming up? How about the stock market: would you invest in shares without checking their values and trend? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In team management, you can have all sorts of KPIs to measure and display how well your team is doing: productivity, lead time, bugs, … Tracking those metrics helps the team to identify problems early and improve. The only one that is missing is the actual mood and motivation of your team members. And I don’t need to tell you &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;how important it is for the good of the project&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason why, a few years ago (in 2006 more precisely), Akinori SAKATA invented the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html&quot;&gt;Niko-niko calendar&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. the smiley calendar or the happiness index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/happy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Happy worker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;What is the Niko-niko calendar?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko calendar is the application of a very important principle in Agile project management defined by american engineer and Agile expert Tom Gilb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure doesn’t have to be perfect nor precise. The objective is to quantify something that wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/nikoniko-calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Niko-Niko calendar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does the Niko-niko calendar work? It’s a simple calendar with everybody’s name on it. At the end of the day, each team member is invited to share their mood of the day, sticking smilies happy :-), straight :-| or frowning :-( or color stickers on it. That’s actually where its name comes from: Niko means smile in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko doesn’t provide an exact measure of the team’s mood, but it helps quantifying the well-being, morale and motivation – three factors that are usually difficult to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s spirit is even more important for an Agile team as the success of the project relies on it. It’s the reason why the Niko-niko calendar was first invented for Agile teams. It provides a general view of how well the team is doing, and not just at individual level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-the-niko-niko-method&quot;&gt;How to use the Niko-niko method?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko must follow some principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone’s mood should be visible to the others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should never be hold against someone or be considered as an individual objective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moods should be observed during the next day’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;daily meeting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The manager / team leader / scrum master should try to understand and treat “abnormality”, good or bad: a common bad day shared by the whole team, a person that is constantly happy while the rest of the team is unhappy and vice-versa, a general deterioration of the team’s mood, a shared “happy” mood even if the project isn’t good wel…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/sad.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sad worker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In concrete terms, to use the Niko-niko method, you can build &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/niko-niko/diy/2013/05/07/build-your-own-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;your own Niko-niko calendar&lt;/a&gt; with a daily calendar and a stack of color stickers. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/l/Niko-Niko/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=evaluating-your-team-s-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_evaluating-your-team-s-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;choose to use an online tool&lt;/a&gt; if your team is working remotely, or simply if you want to be able to analyze trends. An online tool can also help you gather comments more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-leverage-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;How to leverage the Niko-niko calendar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let your Niko-niko hang there for nothing! Quantifying your team’s mood is only the first step, you need to be able to act on it, where your team is in a good or bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html&quot;&gt;Reacting to one of several teammates’ bad mood&lt;/a&gt; can seem pretty obvious: you don’t want a bad situation to degenerate, and you need your team to be at its best in order to deliver results. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html&quot;&gt;understanding and leveraging your team’s good mood&lt;/a&gt; is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from a Niko-niko calendar is a huge opportunity for reflection. You can get instant feedback from changes that are altering the work environment. It can also be included in a reporting for top management (leaving it anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you convinced? Start implementing a Niko-niko calendar in your team, either by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/niko-niko/diy/2013/05/07/build-your-own-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;building it yourself&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/l/Niko-Niko/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=evaluating-your-team-s-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_evaluating-your-team-s-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;using an online one such as TeamMood&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Cultivate a Workplace Culture of Gratitude</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-core-beliefs-and-culture.pdf&quot;&gt;88% of employees and 94% of executives&lt;/a&gt; say that they believe company culture is crucial to success. If you want to create a powerful environment for your business, then you need to be willing to prize and prioritize the right ideas for your employees. For instance, one value worth cultivating is “gratitude”. Employees who are thankful for where they are and what they accomplish will constantly go above and beyond to serve their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, how do you bring a culture of gratitude into your workplace? The following steps could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-by-setting-an-example&quot;&gt;1. Start by Setting an Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you want to implement a change in your company culture, the first thing you need to do is think about how you can set the right example. Remember, as the owner or manager of your business, you’re not just someone who cuts pay-checks and tells people what to do every day. You’re the leader that your employees turn to when they’re looking for advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/thanks.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Showing gratitude&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people see you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlsun/2017/12/18/how-to-create-a-culture-of-gratitude-in-the-workplace/2/#6cd446847df8&quot;&gt;practicing gratitude every day&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll start to embrace the concept as a natural part of your workplace culture. So, how do you bring gratitude into your life? That’s simple. All you need to do is start showing your appreciation for things - both little and big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone accomplishes a task in your organization, show them how much you appreciate it by giving them a pat on the back. When you meet your goals or targets, share that with your team and show them how every success adds up in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recognize-your-employees-in-the-way-they-prefer&quot;&gt;2. Recognize Your Employees in the Way They Prefer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is one of the most powerful things changing modern workforces. In fact, according to some studies, approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.workstars.com/recognition-and-engagement-blog/2017/08/18/10-knockout-employee-recognition-statistics-for-hr-infographic/&quot;&gt;69% of employees&lt;/a&gt; say that they would work harder and take on more responsibilities if they felt their efforts were appreciated. If you want to make sure that you’re building a culture of gratitude for your organization, start by thanking your employees for their hard work in a manner they can really resonate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some small achievements, a simple “thank you” can be enough to make your staff feel better about their career. For bigger accomplishments, you might look for more significant ways to show your recognition. For instance, you could throw an office party celebrating a huge client win or share a company newsletter that highlights your top performers. Some organization still think that the “employee of the month” strategy works well as a way of keeping their hires happy too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-your-people-reasons-to-be-thankful&quot;&gt;3. Give Your People Reasons to be Thankful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where countless companies are beginning to explore ideas like remote working to help their employees tackle stress and workplace gyms for wellbeing, it pays to go above and beyond for your staff. If you want your employees to feel excited by the fact that they’re part of your team, and you’re hoping that your reputation as an excellent employer will spread to lure new talent to your company, then look for creative ways to make your staff smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little extras and benefits you put into place to delight your team will depend on what they appreciate most. For instance, academic minds might like it if you sign them up for trips to regular conferences and training sessions. Plenty of employees like having an opportunity to expand and improve their skills. Providing this education not only makes your hires happy, but also gives you access to new talents too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, giving your employees a reason to be thankful could be as simple as signing them up for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javapresse.com/pages/subscriptions-gifts&quot;&gt;monthly coffee subscription&lt;/a&gt;, so that they can enjoy fresh java every day. This not only stops people from complaining about the stale drinks you previously had in your office kitchen, it also gives your team the antioxidants and great flavor they need to boost their mood and their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;look-for-ways-to-give-back&quot;&gt;4. Look for Ways to Give Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing a true culture of gratitude means more than giving something back to your employees. It could also mean that you look for ways to support your community and local causes that need your help. Signing up for a partnership with a charity that your team cares about and giving them paid leave to go and offer their services to that organization is a great way to share the idea of gratitude far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with charities gives your employees an opportunity to express their gratitude for the privileges they enjoy as part of your company, and essentially share the wealth. As well as allowing staff to take part in formal programs, you could also ask employees to come up with and suggest their own initiatives. You’d be surprised how much a caring nature matters to today’s hires. Modern employees - &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonprofithub.org/volunteer-management/study-finds-millennials-are-ready-to-change-the-world/&quot;&gt;particularly those in the millennial demographic&lt;/a&gt;, like to feel as though they’re having an impact on the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing your team that you’re willing to give something back both improves your culture of gratitude and may help you to attract new candidates to your company too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-time-to-reflect&quot;&gt;5. Take Time to Reflect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, sometimes the best way to nurture a culture of gratitude in your company is to simply slow down. When you stop rushing around after deadlines and take the time to stop and smell the coffee every now and again, it’s easier to reflect on where you are, and where you came from. Although running a business can be hard work, when you begin to reflect, you’ll realize just how lucky you’ve been so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the toughest of times, most of us have something to be grateful for. Whether it’s a family back home that supports you or a great USP in your business, make sure that you appreciate what you have. Try to encourage moments of reflection for your team, so that they never lose sight of the positive things in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the author&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Raj Jana is the CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javapresse.com/pages/subscriptions-gifts&quot;&gt;JavaPresse&lt;/a&gt; and a strong advocate of the power of company culture. He enjoys sharing his advice on how to build a successful company and often uses his experiences to help him write insightful articles for blogs across the internet.
Company culture has quickly become one of the most important components of a successful business. After all, your people can either make or break your company. If they’re happy and satisfied with their jobs, then they’re sure to be more productive and focused in their roles. On the other hand, if they’re constantly looking forward to the moment that they can clock out and go home, then your organization will struggle to thrive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Leverage Your Team’s Good Mood</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is happiness in the air? Are your teammates smiling and joking around? Is your team productivity skyrocketing? Congratulations, your team is in a good mood! And the results are there: your team delivers in no time, the job is well-done, they are more creative and thorough… The dream comes true :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s next? If you rest on your laurels and hope for the situation to go on forever, you will most certainly be disappointed. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html&quot;&gt;when your team is experiencing a bad mood&lt;/a&gt;, you must understand the causes for this happy mood in order to keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-the-situation-permanent-or-temporary&quot;&gt;Is the situation permanent or temporary?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you recently noticed a sudden change of mood or is the situation more or less stable? And if it’s stable, has is always been like that or has the situation evolve over the months/years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a century ago, American researcher and professor of educational psychology Bruce Wayne Tuckman developed a theory of group dynamics, published in his article &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1965-12187-001&quot;&gt;Developmental sequence in small groups&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Tuckman’s theory of group development, every group grows through 4 phases: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and Adjourning. These phases are necessary and inevitable in order for the team to grow, face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results. They are usually followed by a fifth phase named “Adjourning”, that involves completing the task and breaking up the team, paving the way for a new exciting project to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/tuckman_s_stages_of_development.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tuckman&#39;s Stages of Development&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: http://margarethillary.com/team-work/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering your happy team, are they currently in a Forming stage? Norming? Performing? Understanding the group dynamic can help you better anticipate the changes and help your teammates be at their utmost performance. Indeed, in each stage, you can use different strategies in order to facilitate the development of high performing teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forming: picking the team, discuss the goals, make sure the team develops a shared mental model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forming: act as a resource person to the team, develop mutual trust and calm the work environment by resolving conflicts and tensions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Norming &amp;amp; Performing: get feedback from your teammates, allow for the transfer of leadership, set aside time for planning and engaging the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outperforming &amp;amp; Adjourning: expand initiatives and integrate new members, allow for flexibility in team roles, create future leadership opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-root-or-simple-causes&quot;&gt;What are the (root or simple) causes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If root causes can be explained by Tuckman’s stages, a good mood can simply be the consequence of a team building activity that was particularly appreciated, a habit to bring in croissants at the end of each sprint, a new wellness program…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;boost wellbeing and happiness at work&lt;/a&gt; with theses simple acts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a culture of trust and transparency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html&quot;&gt;Show gratitude and value positive intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foster empowerment and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Favor breaks and downtime&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch a project that people care about / are proud of&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Favor friendship and informal times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more than anything else, don’t forget to take the time to celebrate successes or good news with your team. These moments of commemoration and gratitude are essential to keep your team’s motivation up and pave the way to new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you cannot manage everything, some external sources can cause a happy or bad mood, beyond your control. The best thing you can do? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=how-to-leverage-your-team-s-good-mood&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_how-to-leverage-your-team-s-good-mood&quot;&gt;Ask your team members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Your team is in a bad mood? Here’s what you need to do.</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Either you are sensing there is an issue in your team or you are using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-here-s-what-you-need-to-do&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-here-s-what-you-need-to-do&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; that tells you so, you can’t afford to ignore it. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;a bad mood will affect your team productivity&lt;/a&gt;: unhappy people are proven to be &lt;strong&gt;10% less productive&lt;/strong&gt; than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if a bad situation arises, here is what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-to-the-roots-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;1 - Get to the roots of the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel some tension among team members, unspoken issues or a general growing discontent, you need to understand where it’s coming from. Small quarrels or disagreements are usually fueled by a deeper issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/why.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Chicken and pigs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a stressful deadline coming up? Were there a change in the strategic orientation of the product? Is the company to be going through a bad patch? A specific individual driving everyone’s morale down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html&quot;&gt;paying attention to the signs&lt;/a&gt;, big or small, or use a tool to anonymously question your team members such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-here-s-what-you-need-to-do&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-here-s-what-you-need-to-do&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discuss-the-situation&quot;&gt;2 - Discuss the situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know (or think to know) the situation and its causes, you must discuss it with your team members, individually or as a team according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bad mood is a general state shared by the whole or part of your team, you can address the issue quickly during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;Daily standup meeting&lt;/a&gt; or come back to it during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/a&gt; (but beware not to let the situation settle in and worsen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s more an individual state, let everyone know that you are open and willing to discuss whatever problem they may have. And encourage your team to share their issue in an anonymous comment if they don’t want to discuss it openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-a-solution-together&quot;&gt;3 - Find a solution together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, “Two heads are better than one.” If you try to find a solution on your own, it’s likely that it will fail: your team members may not subscribe to it, or you’ll just miss the point and the responsibility will fall on your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have different options here: you can choose to discuss the solution in a team meeting, to set up an anonymous idea box or an open board, to have one-on-one formal discussions or a group informal chat during a team afterwork…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arouse-friendliness&quot;&gt;4 - Arouse friendliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snacknation.com/blog/employee-happiness/&quot;&gt;close work friendships&lt;/a&gt; boost employee satisfaction by 50%&lt;/strong&gt; and that people with a &lt;strong&gt;best friend at work are 7 times more likely to engage fully in their work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/friends-tv-show.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chicken and pigs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, if you want your team to work hard and get results, you need to create the perfect environment. Of course, you can’t force your team members to become friends. But you can create the conditions for people to bond: team afterwork at the end of the sprint, lunch break together once in a while, team building activities…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lead-by-example&quot;&gt;5 - Lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you be in the middle of the storm or simply handle a temporary decrease in employee moral, don’t forget that your attitude as a manager will greatly impact your team members. Set the example by having a positive and open speech, sharing information transparently, being attentive and openly share your own problems. Don’t forget also to show gratitude to your employees and to praise their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply by acknowledging their issues and recognizing their effort and/or results, you can turn the situation around and motivate your team members again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Best Practices To Run Effective Daily Standup Meetings</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Daily Meeting (or Daily Scrum) is one of the key elements of Scrum and some other agile methods. It is set to happen every day of a Sprint (= a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed) in order to foster &lt;strong&gt;communication and collaboration between the whole team&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to be effective, a Daily standup Meeting should follow these 8 rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rules-to-run-effective-daily-scrum-meetings&quot;&gt;8 rules to run effective Daily Scrum Meetings:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-day-same-time-same-place&quot;&gt;1 - Every day, same time, same place&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but the very first rule to &lt;strong&gt;Daily Meetings is that it should happen every day of a Sprint&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally at the beginning of a working day. Every team member must attend, as it helps to organize the work of the day and to make sure the team as a whole is working towards the completion of the Sprint objectives. It can also prevent two team members from working on the same task without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stand-up-meeting-aka-daily-scrum&quot;&gt;2 - Stand up meeting AKA “Daily Scrum”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;strong&gt;core principles of the Daily Scrum is that it should happen standing up&lt;/strong&gt;. It may seem a gimmick but it actually reduces rambling and helps team members staying focused. Being seated, it is very easy to take your laptop or smartphone out and start disengaging from the meeting. Moreover, standing up encourages everyone to keep the meeting short (ideally no more than 15 minutes) and focus on what’s important, keeping the discussions for after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy solution is to hold the meeting in a room without chairs or to put all the chairs on one side of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions here, some teams may comfortably sit down if they are using an online Scrum board; in that case, they share the screen, and everyone focuses on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;question-agenda&quot;&gt;3 - 3-question agenda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Daily Scrum, everyone is supposed to answer those three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did you accomplish since the last Daily Meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are you working on until the next Daily Meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is getting in your way or keeping you from doing your job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daily Meeting should not be considered as a status report to overlook teammates’ work or micromanage the team. It should really be about fostering discussion and collaboration among team members to make sure everything is going smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to do it is to use a Scrum Board (physical or online) and post-its to visualize all the tasks to be completed during the Sprint, all the ongoing ones and the ones that are already done. Each team members can comment the task chosen during the last daily, discuss potential issues and select a new one to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;address-problems-without-solving-them&quot;&gt;4 - Address problems without solving them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third question of the Daily Standup Meeting is key: it’s the perfect occasion to &lt;strong&gt;share an issue or ask for help&lt;/strong&gt;. But don’t you try resolving it right away. The Daily Standup Meeting shouldn’t be a technical one, talking about solutions and choices. If you want to respect your agenda and give the floor to each teammate in the allotted time, keep the technical discussions for after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, new ideas should be addressed outside the Daily Meeting, in order to leave some space for discussion (which can’t happen in a 15-minute meeting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-team-decides-what-to-do-next&quot;&gt;5 - The team decides what to do next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, the Daily Scrum Meeting is not an opportunity for the Scrum Master to micro-manage and impose what to do next. In fact, his or her main task is to ensure that the Daily Meetings are held, that the 3 main questions are answered, and that impediments are identified so that a possible resolution can be set in motion. Once the habit of holding Daily Meeting every day is set and the team understand the value of the meeting, they can hold it on their own, the Scrum Master no longer has to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Daily Meeting, each team member can select a task he or she feels like doing, based on their competences, experience and the overall criticality of the tasks. Letting everyone being &lt;strong&gt;his or her own boss&lt;/strong&gt; is the best way to get them &lt;strong&gt;excited and committed to the success of the project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;giving-the-floor-to-those-who-are-committed&quot;&gt;6 - Giving the floor to those who are committed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the golden rules is: &lt;strong&gt;the Daily Standup Meeting is a meeting for and by those who are committed&lt;/strong&gt;, who are really working on the project. The very aim of the Daily Meeting is to provide a space and time for teammates to discuss. They should be central to the meeting – if other people who are just “involved” (directors, stakeholders…) want to speak, they should wait for the end of the stand-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;http://www.implementingscrum.com/images/060911-scrumtoon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chicken and pigs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-scrum-master-makes-the-connection-with-the-outside&quot;&gt;7 - The Scrum Master makes the connection with the outside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Daily Meeting cannot be the sole means of team communication, it can be the opportunity for the Scrum Master to share information if he or she decides to attend. In fact, he or she should act as the information conduit in and out of the team boundary: passing external information to the team, and team information to external stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: “Hey, just to let you know the other team is having a demo of their new feature tomorrow. Maybe you want to go and see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or “I’ve contacted IT about expediting that new build server… I’ll have more info tomorrow”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or “The marketing team is throwing a happy hour tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;celebrate-success-and-understand-issues&quot;&gt;8 - Celebrate success and understand issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t make the mistake of taking the Daily Scrum Meeting for a shared to-do list. It’s also the time to &lt;strong&gt;celebrate successes and address issues as a team&lt;/strong&gt;. Using a tool like TeamMood to measure your team members’ mood and feelings can provide you with great insights for your Daily Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Daily Meeting, you can take the time to check in on the history of TeamMood, see if there are small wins or developing trends. Identify small issues you can deal with today like “We ran out of coffee”. Of course, larger issues should be addressed during &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot;&gt;retrospectives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one of our clients, “During our Daily Meeting, team members could share their thoughts and explain low ratings. TeamMood provided employees with the opportunity to speak up and got a dialogue going on among the team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another client shares his use of TeamMood: “We take the TeamMood results into the retrospective from time to time, to share comments. However, throughout the sprints, I keep an eye on the team’s mood. Any concerning dips and I will start looking into the cause…”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managers, do you know how to work with millennials?</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The key motivation factors in the workplace have shifted along generations, from job security to promotions and career evolution. But more recently, even high paychecks and bonuses don’t seem to matter that much for the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;managing-millennials-a-new-challenge&quot;&gt;Managing millennials: a new challenge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for this new generation, work cannot just be a trivial, down-to-earth activity to make a living. Millennials tend to treat work as an experience, competing with other activities and hobbies. It has to be exciting, fulfilling, rewarding. What’s the point of waking up if it’s just to earn a salary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, historical incentives don’t work anymore: bonus, promotion, and profit-sharing are unable to motivate employees on their own. Indeed, millennials don’t share their elders’ unbreakable loyalty to their company and can switch easily to a more attractive one – or just leave their job to travel around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/working_with_millenials.png&quot; alt=&quot;Working With Millenials&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same time, attracting and retaining the best talents is of strategic importance for companies. As the environment becomes increasingly competitive, key resources are companies’ most valuable asset. And the process of recruiting and training new employees on a specific job can be very costly. So, here are the 4 main drivers to attract, motivate and retain millennial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;drivers-that-work-for-the-millennial-worker&quot;&gt;Drivers that work for the millennial worker&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say that millennials are not interested in working, are lazy and disobedient. That’s wrong, studies prove that they are, as much as their elders, committed to their work. But they are also sensitive to different incentives. And if companies want to attract and retain the best talents, managers need to adapt to these changes and better understand their drivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empowerment-and-ownership&quot;&gt;Empowerment and ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that millennial workers don’t accept hierarchy – on the contrary, they strive for a mentor that would make them learn and grow. But they do want to feel empowered, to own their project and be responsible, for better or for worse. Feeling like the simple executant of a task that was decided outside of them drive millennials crazy – you can be sure that they’ll quickly lose their motivation, hence their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is your company organized? Are all decisions taken by the top managers of each branch or do you leave some responsibility to project owners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexibility&quot;&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the worst for a millennial at work? To feel like in a prison at work. In order to be motivated and efficient, they want to feel free to organize their day as they wish. They may have a look at Facebook to take a break during their work day, and then answer an email from work at night, from their couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials also value work-life balance: they want their company to be understanding and flexible about office hours. Arriving later for the late-sleepers or leaving earlier for those who need or want to shouldn’t be a problem. Likewise, millennials really appreciate the freedom to work remotely, at least once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your company more focused on effort or results? Have you implemented a remote-work policy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bigger-goal&quot;&gt;A bigger goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work shouldn’t be “just” about making a living, it has to be meaningful. Millennials want to adhere to their company’s values and goal. They want to earn a good living while doing work that matters. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html&quot;&gt;Deloitte study&lt;/a&gt;, millennials feel accountable for many issues worldwide. Opportunities to be involved with “good causes” at the local level provide millennials with a greater feeling of influence – even better if enabled by their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you defined company values that go beyond economic profit? Do you take on pro bono missions, actively participate in associations or encourage your employees to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunities-to-learn-and-grow&quot;&gt;Opportunities to learn and grow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital generation is keen on learning and acquiring new competencies. The knowledge acquired during university is no longer sufficient and quickly irrelevant. Wikipedia, MOOCs, online diplomas, videos, serious games… everything works to help the millennials grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers and human resources would better get up to speed. Having a comprehensive learning and development program makes a difference when it’s time to choose the company to work for – and to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you updated your learning and development programs to better fit the company’s needs? Do you take into account employees’ wishes? How much of your payroll do you spend on learning and development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-forms-of-work-in-the-digital-economy&quot;&gt;New forms of work in the digital economy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our digital world, not only the motivation drivers have changed, the work itself is evolving. More and more people choose to work remotely, or even go freelance. And the impact on managers is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, freelance workers already make up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/new-study-finds-freelance-economy-grew-55-million-americans-this-year-35-total-us-workforce-2164446.htm&quot;&gt;35% of the US&lt;/a&gt; workforce and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.staffingindustry.com/eng/Editorial/Daily-News/EU-Number-of-freelancers-grows-by-24-in-7-years-38211?&quot;&gt;24% in Europe&lt;/a&gt; – and the numbers keep growing. Who knows where this trend can drive us? Imagine a world where workers are no longer employed by a single company, but provide services for different companies according to the business needs and their competencies. Of course this situation would require some evolutions in terms of freelance security and rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/critisism_millenials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Ways Of Working Between Generations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this futuristic world, managers are conductors of a multi-located team of workers. They have to get everyone aligned with the company’s strategic objectives and working towards the same goal, despite their time engagement on the project (a few hours, a few days per week, …). Managers will have to leverage new technologies and communication tools in order to share the company culture and foster a sense of belonging to the company. Understanding individual aspirations and feelings will be crucial to the overall performance of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managers, be prepared: your job is about to change drastically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Simple Guide to Run Agile Retrospectives</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In our ever-evolving environment, we hear more and more about Scrum, XP, and other Agile methods. If they have their differences, they all have in common one principle: teams must adapt over time and continuously improve the way they work. And &lt;strong&gt;retrospectives&lt;/strong&gt; are the cornerstone to this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-retrospective&quot;&gt;What is a retrospective?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a context of continuous improvement, a retrospective helps team members improve the way they work together based on the past weeks’ events. During a retrospective, the team reflects on what happened in the timeframe and identifies actions for improvement going forward. It lays halfway between between lessons learned and an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wonder: &lt;em&gt;do I really need retrospectives&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you may think your team organization is already optimized, you probably don’t realize some of the issues and frustrations your teammates encounter daily. Taking the time to discuss them and find solutions is key to improve the way your team works, and overall to improve your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/are-you-too-busy-to-improve2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Too Busy To Improve: use retrospectives to reflect on your process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-a-retrospective-work&quot;&gt;How does a retrospective work?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of formats of retrospectives, and none that you should adopt for good – otherwise it will become too repetitive and end up being inefficient. But whatever the format, it should always include 2 axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate successes&lt;/strong&gt;: a new client, a feature release, …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss the issues and irritants&lt;/strong&gt; – from the smallest (the coffee is bad) to the biggest (we need new fundings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to identify the 2 or 3 most urging and important issues, define some actions to solve them and distribute them among the teammates. At the next retrospective, people will share their feedback: were they able to put the measures in place? Have they had a positive impact? If not, should we insist or give up? And the cycle goes on. In this type of organization, the manager is no longer the only one responsible for making his or her team happy and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to select 2 to 3 items only, because the team will have a hard time focusing on more during the next Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives usually last for half an hour to one hour, and occur at the end of a cycle or iteration – ideally every two weeks, at most every month. And should include all team members: it’s the collective that makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tools-to-make-your-retrospective-work-better&quot;&gt;3 tools to make your retrospective work better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of tools available there, those are the ones we enjoy the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retromathttpsplans-for-retrospectivescomen--to-get-inspiration-on-retrospective-formats&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/en/&quot;&gt;Retromat&lt;/a&gt; – to get inspiration on retrospective formats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, it’s better to use a new format for each of your retrospectives in order to maintain their efficiency. Retromat is an online tool which helps you find inspiration for your retrospectives. You can browse around or select a random plan, change it to fit the team’s situation, print it and share the URL to your teammates. It’s that easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retriumhttpswwwretriumcom--to-run-retrospectives-with-distributed-teams&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retrium.com/&quot;&gt;Retrium&lt;/a&gt; – to run retrospectives with distributed teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives are even more important for multi-located teams – and at the same time more difficult to run. If you are managing a distributed team, you should consider using a tool like Retrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrium is a web-app that helps you run your retrospectives. It provides you with the tools and methodology to run effective retrospectives and identify concrete, outside-of-the-box ideas on how to improve the way you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being online, Retrium helps you organize your retrospective even with a distributed team. Everyone has access to the ideas and comments their colleagues shared. It provides the opportunity for teammates to bring up topics that would normally stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teammoodhttpswwwteammoodcomutmsourceblogutmmediumpostutmcontenta-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectivesutmcampaignbloga-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives--to-get-topics-from-the-teammates-to-discuss-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt; – to get topics from the teammates to discuss about&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not us, it’s our clients who say it! If you run retrospectives every two weeks or every month, it’s hard to remember everything that happened during this timeframe. You usually end up focusing on the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TeamMood, you can have access to daily feedback and comments from your team members during the whole period. It works as a team’s diary. Using this data during your retrospectives helps you get a comprehensive view of what happened, and enriches or starts interesting  discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives&quot;&gt;Discover TeamMood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Best Practices From Our Users</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2017/12/06/best-practices-from-our-users.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2017/12/06/best-practices-from-our-users.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is good, but you still need to act on it. Many of our customers have asked us advice on how to make the best use of the data collected thanks to TeamMood. So, here comes a compilation of the best practices to leverage TeamMood and have a real impact on your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;giving-the-floor-to-team-members-during-daily-meetings&quot;&gt;Giving the floor to team members during daily meetings…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our users, one of the great advantages of TeamMood is its daily tracking. Other similar tools work weekly or monthly, which is not enough to really track the mood of your team and follow trends. And once you track the mood of your team daily, you can share the results daily too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel is an agile coach who intervenes as a consultant in different IT teams. He uses TeamMood during his daily meetings in order to talk openly about the bad moods and comments. It triggers the discussions and helps the team quickly find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another client of ours also started to share daily the results from the previous day, an average and the overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;body&quot;&gt; “During our daily meeting, people started to speak up and explain the reasons behind a certain grade or comment. It released the floor and initiated dialog among the team.”&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Guillaume&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-lightening-up-the-mood&quot;&gt;… and lightening up the mood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TeamMood doesn’t have to be all serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/laughing.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our clients, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guestonline.io/&quot;&gt;GuestOnline&lt;/a&gt;, created a game based on TeamMood’s results. At the end of some particularly long meetings, to relax everyone, they share some of the comments from TeamMood and make a quiz ‘guess who wrote this comment’. They also invented a variant to this game at the end of summer, with holiday pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;body&quot;&gt; “At the beginning, I felt the team was a bit feebleness, but after a while it became a time of relaxing and fun at the end of a big meeting. Everyone participates, and sometimes people share the story behind a certain mood. We all have a good time and finish the meeting on a positive and happy note :)”&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Emilie, GuestOnline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-retrospectives&quot;&gt;Improving retrospectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/postits.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running retrospectives with your teammates on a regular basis is crucial to learn from past mistakes and try to do better. That’s why the best companies take the time to review past projects, analyse what went wrong or could be improved upon, and share new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you run retrospectives every week, two weeks of every months, it’s hard to remember everything that happened during your timeframe. Without a tool like TeamMood, your retrospectives end up focusing on the past few days, leaving aside older events or issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to TeamMood, you can have access to daily feedback and comments from your team members. Your retrospective are richer and more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-teammood-as-a-management-tool&quot;&gt;Using TeamMood as a management tool&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than the result of the daily poll on itself, what is important is how you react on it. Indeed, TeamMood provides managers with data and feedback to gauge their team’s feeling and well-being, but they still have to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean-Baptiste, an IT manager at a big French retail outfit company, shares: “I don’t just look at the score for each team. What’s more important is to see how a Scrum Master responds and helps the team navigate their way through any problems that arise.” (Read the full story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/en/success/Success-story-scrum-masters-en.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-the-most-urging-topics&quot;&gt;Identifying the most urging topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TeamMood doesn’t provide just a grade but also gives the opportunity for team members to share a comment, providing more context or information on a specific issue. In order to identify the most urging topic, one of our clients, working in a research company, classifies the daily comments by category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, he can directly pinpoint his efforts to the most recurring and urging topics, and relieve his teammates of their issues. It helps him identify trends on different topics, for instance a need in recruitment or a tight deadline. It also gives him insights to whether the subject has been addressed and solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inv-tweet-sa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=TeamMood%20is%20a%20true%20managerial%20help.%20https://blog.teammood.com/2017/12/06/best-practices-from-our-users.html&quot;&gt;
    “TeamMood is a true managerial help.”

        <title>How to Defuse Conflicts at Work in 5 Steps</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html&quot;&gt;identified the signs of an upcoming conflict at work&lt;/a&gt;, you need to resolve it before it burst. I’m going to kill the dream right away: conflicts don’t resolve by themselves. You have to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts are sensitive subjects for most people, whether they fight it or decide to flight. Some cultures even find it rude and disrespectful to disagree or oppose someone, especially at work, in a situation of hierarchy. Wouldn’t be easier to consider conflicts like any other problem to be solved, with a specific methodology? You’re in luck, we’ve gathered all the literature on the topic to craft you the perfect guide to solve conflicts at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example. You’ve recently been hired to handle a 2-year project that just started. The team seems nice overall, but you feel some resistance from one of the members – let’s call him Alex. Rumours warn you that this person was actually seeking this position, but even if he was showing a lot of enthusiasm, the management decided he wasn’t senior enough so his application was turned down. How do you handle it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/handshake.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talk-about-the-conflict&quot;&gt;1 - Talk about the conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t say it enough, communication is key. I’m not talking about warning the whole company or complain at every coffee break. On the contrary, communication should always be respectful and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inv-tweet-sa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Communication%20should%20always%20be%20respectful%20and%20constructive%20at%20the%20workplace.%20https://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html&quot;&gt;
    “Communication should always be respectful and constructive at the workplace.”
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter-hover&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, I would first try to gather information about Alex from your own boss and/or the person that hired you (and not him). Try to get feedback on the way he usually acts within a team, what he likes or dislikes… but be subtle or people will ask questions and the entire company may end up getting involved in the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you should talk to the interested party. Again, subtility is the rule, you don’t want him to feel attacked. Putting a situation of conflict into words is always a good start to resolving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try something like: “Alex, I have felt some resistance from your part [or even aggressivity if applicable], am I misinterpreting or is there something we should talk about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;put-yourself-in-the-other-persons-shoes&quot;&gt;2 - Put yourself in the other person’s shoes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a situation of conflict, every part feels in its own right and tends to defend his or her position. As a result, your empathy for the other one will most certainly fall to its lowest. In order to start moving the lines and restore some empathy in the relationship, start by putting yourself in the other person’s shoes, and ask him or her to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s not directly your fault – you’re not the one who made the decision to hire yourself – it’s very easy to imagine why Alex would feel reluctant about you. You embody both his dream and his failure. Wouldn’t you feel the same if you were him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inv-tweet-sa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Empathy%20is%20key%20to%20conflict%20resolution.%20https://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html&quot;&gt;
    “Empathy is key to conflict resolution.”
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter-hover&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop there, ask him to do the same: “I understand your situation. Now, could I ask you to do the same for me? I’m new in this project and this company, and this position means a lot to me. How would you feel if you were me? I really need all of project team members to be 100% onboard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-the-very-person-involved-in-this-conflict-to-find-a-solution&quot;&gt;3 - Ask the very person involved in this conflict to find a solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you define a solution on your side, chances are that the person involved won’t fully agree or apply them. You want this person to get his or her hands “dirty” in solving the conflict – it’s much harder to reject something you first agreed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, simply ask Alex what would make him feel better about this project. Maybe working closer to you would get him the experience he was originally lacking to handle the project. Or on the contrary, giving him more responsibility would make him more comfortable to learn and grow. Another project may be coming up, on which you could refer him based on the first months working together – on the condition that he actually gets better involved. Agreeing on a solution will immediately make things easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;call-on-a-third-person&quot;&gt;4 - Call on a third person&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t handle the situation by yourself, you should seek out from some help. The key here is to call in somebody that both parties respect and trust (if possible, outside of your direct hierarchy). In some companies, one person (or more) is in charge of employee protection and social dialogue. While bound to professional and with total neutrality, this person can help you reach a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inv-tweet-sa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Putting%20a%20situation%20of%20conflict%20into%20words%20is%20always%20a%20good%20start%20to%20resolving%20it.%20https://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html&quot;&gt;
    “Putting a situation of conflict into words is always a good start to resolving it.”
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sa-icon-twitter-hover&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, management or the HR department might offer you the services of an external mediator. Being external (and hence neutral) to the organization, a mediator will have better chances of resolving the conflict – if he or she succeeds in gaining the two parties’ trust. Indeed, the mediator’s ultimate role is to do anything and everything necessary to assist parties to reach an agreement, by educating them, questioning and clarifying the situation, remembering the roles and responsibilities of each individual, etc. However, he or she can’t define a settlement by him/herself, the persons involved in the conflict ultimately have to find an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;move-on-from-the-conflict&quot;&gt;5 - Move on from the conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve done all of the above and nothing’s worked, the solution may be for one of the two people involved to move on: go and work in another department, or even leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, Alex might be interested in working on this new project that is about to start. Or on the contrary, agree to leave with a comfortable package from the company. Beware: the risk there is to set the example of bad behavior getting people what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts should be handled with diligence yet precaution. The good thing about a conflict is that when overtaken, it can create an even better work relationship, based on communication and trust. But in order to reach this situation, you must act with kindness and respect, and inspire the other person to do so: those are the principles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://firstround.com/review/power-up-your-team-with-nonviolent-communication-principles/&quot;&gt;NonViolent Communication&lt;/a&gt;, a communication process I strongly encourage you to go into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop fearing conflicts and start handling them!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

“Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger
&lt;br /&gt;
More than ever, hour after, our work is never over&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;[Ante-scriptum: This article is best read while listening to Daft Punk]&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society, our bosses, and even Daft Punk tell us to work harder and be more productive, at any cost. In recent years, however, companies have begun to realize that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;productivity at any cost can be unproductive&lt;/a&gt;. To remedy this, they have started to introduce greater flexibility and more perks at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are on the same wavelength and eager to enhance the well-being at your office, here is our selection of exclusive tools and startups that you’ll soon find indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goodco--find-your-match&quot;&gt;Good&amp;amp;Co – find your match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hiring process is always a sensitive subject for companies. It can be long and costly, especially if the candidate you end up hiring turns out not to be the right fit for the company. The best candidate is not just the smartest or the most creative person, but the one who best complements your company and your current employees, and who makes your team stronger ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://good.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/8-tools/good-co.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://good.co/&quot;&gt;Good&amp;amp;Co&lt;/a&gt; is half matchmaker, half headhunter. Based on a proprietary psychometric algorithm, the platform helps job seekers identify their core strengths and professional persona, to assess whether they’ll be a good fit for a company. As the founders say, “It’s only when a job feels like it was made for you that work feels less like work and more like play. Productivity and success follow naturally”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;noisli--boost-productivity--with-noise&quot;&gt;Noisli – boost productivity … with noise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that noise can actually be better for productivity than total silence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may feel counter-intuitive, but studies show that productivity levels are higher when people are working in a coffee shop surrounded by a background buzz of conversation than in a quiet, empty room. But the level of noise has to be just right – a bar playing Daft Punk as loud as in a club may not be so effective, with the exception being the writing of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.noisli.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/8-tools/noisli.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noisli.com/&quot;&gt;Noisli&lt;/a&gt; is a background noise generator that helps drown out annoying noises and lets you create your ideal environment for working and relaxing. Whether it be the sound of the wind, raindrops, fire, or the actual background noise of a coffee shop, you can choose the atmosphere that will make you focus best and boost your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retrium--learn-from-your-failures-and-successes&quot;&gt;Retrium – learn from your failures and successes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger… this is true if you actually learn from your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the best companies take the time to review past projects, analyse what went wrong or could be improved upon, and share new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.retrium.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/8-tools/retrium.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teammood--discover-your-team-members-most-secret-thoughts&quot;&gt;TeamMood – discover your team members’ most secret thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Sorry if it looks a little bit like auto-promotion, but we couldn’t do this article without including TeamMood – after all, we are a tool for wellbeing at work]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you like to know your team members’ feelings and thoughts? Or to identify problems as they arise – and be able to handle them before they escalate? Or to get regular feedback and suggestions from your team members in order to continuously improve your organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=teammood_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=8-exclusive-tools-to-make-your-teammates-happier-at-work&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt; can do for you. Simply by sending a daily email to all of your team members, you can monitor their levels of happiness, collect their comments and be proactive should a problem arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hivy--brings-happiness-to-your-workplace&quot;&gt;Hivy – brings happiness to your workplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do coffee, notepads and a ping-pong table have in common? The same person in your company is probably responsible for buying all of  them, along with all the other everyday purchases for the office. Gathering requests and placing orders can be quite tedious  for your office manager or personal assistant or whoever is charged with the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Hivy comes in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hivyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Hivy&lt;/a&gt; is an office management platform that creates a unique workplace experience. With a web and smartphone app or through a simple Slack command, all the wonderful people in your office can submit requests and make suggestions using Hivy. Office managers can handle their projects and manage the building within the app: get IT support, catering for an event, a cleaning company, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hivyapp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/8-tools/hivy.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with all the material and snacks they need/want, your team members can relax and focus on getting their work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inv-tweet-sa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Snacks,%20hoodies,%20IT%20support%E2%80%A6%20get%20everything%20you%20need%20for%20the%20office%20with%20@hivyapp%20%23wellbeingattheoffice%20https://blog.teammood.com/2017/05/23/8-exclusive-tools-to-make-your-teammates-happier-at-work.html&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exclusive-briq--much-more-than-a-thank-you&quot;&gt;[Exclusive] Briq – much more than a thank you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialists have weighed in: wellbeing at work is strongly correlated with peer recognition, and even more so with personalized, public, and recurring recognition. But you can’t really orchestrate peer recognition within your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://efounders.co/&quot;&gt;eFounders&lt;/a&gt;’ team has created a peer recognition tool, Briq, that allows teammates to thank, to congratulate someone or to cheer someone up with a simple Slack command. The briqs you receive can be used through a set of applications: Bootiq, to buy goodies from the company shop (a company hoodie, a one-month, 6-month, or yearly subscription to Spotify or the gym, etc.), Snacky, to get a coffee or a snack, and much more. Employees can also receive briqs from the company itself, for instance when they share a corporate article on their personal social media, or when they refer someone for an open position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briq is conceived to adapt to each company’s needs and uses: you can personalize the applications and even build you own ones to incentivize actions that matter to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.givebriq.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/8-tools/briq.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started as an internal tool just turned into a project all of its own. Briq is still in private beta, but you can grab an invite here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givebriq.com/&quot;&gt;www.givebriq.com&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8 Warnings That a Crisis Is Looming Among Your Teammates.</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My mum always told me: the most difficult thing about the workplace is not the work itself, but the relationships. Indeed, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.en25.com/Web/CPP/Conflict_report.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2008 in Europe, the US and Brazil, 85% of employees at all levels experience some degree of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If conflict is not dealt with as it arises, months or years of tension and unspoken conflict will take a toll on teamwork, and can eventually degenerate into an open altercation. I have even witnessed a situation in which years of frustration, lack of understanding, and unspoken tension ended in moral harassment charges. &lt;strong&gt;Burying your head in the sand is never a solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are 8 signs of underlying conflict you should pay attention to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underperforming-team-members&quot;&gt;1. Underperforming team members&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workgroup conflict is a huge demotivator: when people are not happy with the work environment, they tend to focus less on their work. If one or several team members are underperforming, being reluctant to do their job, or missing project deadlines, you can be sure that something is off in your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, underperforming team members can aggravate  tension among your teammates. Indeed, if one of our peers is lagging  in terms of productivity and effort, we tend to feel resentful towards them and the manager who is failing to hold them accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lateness-and-absenteeism&quot;&gt;2. Lateness and absenteeism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is conflict in the workplace, employees usually feel like being anywhere else. They tend to come in late, take long breaks to avoid getting back to work, and call in sick more than usual: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/207196&quot;&gt;25% of workers admit that conflict avoidance has led to their own absenteeism or illness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can be  late now and then. But if it becomes an everyday occurrence, then you should broach the subject with your teammate, and give  him or her the opportunity to explain. Beware though, this doesn’t apply to parents of newborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abnormal-sick-leave&quot;&gt;3. Abnormal sick leave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/sick-leave.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict in the workplace is an huge source of stress. If left to fester, this stress can cause a variety of illnesses and medical conditions: increased rates of heart attack, hypertension, and even burnouts. Indeed, according to a study conducted among employees in North America in 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/315848/employee-stress-sources-at-work-in-north-america/&quot;&gt;31 percent of respondents reported that work relationships were a source of stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dysfunctional-meetings&quot;&gt;4. Dysfunctional meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do staff meetings end up turning into gripe sessions instead of brainstorming sessions? Are there some people who always seem to dominate the conversation while others appear annoyed or distracted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If team members are not showing up to meetings, if they are reluctant to participate, or if they display a critical, sceptical or sarcastic attitude during a meeting, consider this a red flag that something is going on in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-cooperation-and-exclusion&quot;&gt;5. Lack of cooperation and exclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/exclusion.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teammates who are reluctant to work together are probably having some interpersonal problems. Conflict can even bring people together in factions against individuals they see as causing problems in the workplace. Behaviors such as sitting in cliques at coffee or lunch breaks, or ‘secretly’ arranging gatherings to which a few specific people are not invited, should warn the manager that something is off within the team and make him or her react quickly to avoid escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disrespect-and-gossip-in-the-workplace&quot;&gt;6. Disrespect and gossip in the workplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intense conflict makes us see others as undeserving of our respect. Being rude to each other, rolling one’s eyes, and turning away while someone is speaking are signs that conflict is brewing. Likewise, gossip and criticism can only lead to animosity and should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of behaviour is actually considered to be a  subtle form of harassment. It can lead to anger and fear among teammates, but management often doesn’t recognize it until pre-litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-exodus-and-resignation&quot;&gt;7. Organizational exodus and resignation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If staff turnover is high, whether it be due to  resignation or transfer requests, you can bet that there is a reason. Over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/207196&quot;&gt;30% of workers state that interpersonal issues have led to someone leaving the organization&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t underestimate how costly employee turnover is for the organization. Given the cost of recruitment, including training a new employee, paying other employees involved in the hiring and training process, severance pay, and the loss of investment involved in losing an existing worker, replacing an employee actually costs  150 to 200 percent more than the original employee’s salary and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-complaints&quot;&gt;8. Formal complaints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/formal-complaint.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If unresolved, conflict between employees can lead to workmates  filing complaints and holding grudges  against each other. And rest assured that investigations, disciplinary proceedings and adjudications don’t bring people together - they just drive people further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve noticed some of these signs or not, you should always strive to keep the lines of communication open between you and your teammates and encourage them to come to you with  any difficulty they may encounter - personal and professional. Unaddressed conflict will always prove more  costly to the organization than a few hours spent trying to resolve it early on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wellbeing at Work: The Benefits of Happiness in the Workplace</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world has never before seen such high levels of productivity – even in France with our 5 weeks of vacation – and it is very much a consequence of the digital revolution and the automatization of many tasks. But the side effects of this faster work pace are not always welcome: burnout, depression, lack of purpose… Is being “sick on the job” the scourge of our age?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing’s for sure: a good paycheck is no longer enough to attract and retain the best talent. And companies know this: chief happiness officers, stress management coaches, and wellbeing programs are emerging to improve happiness in the workplace. So, what is actually at stake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;happiness-at-work-the-key-to-increased-productivity&quot;&gt;Happiness at work, the key to increased productivity?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Warwick in the UK have actually validated the theory. In 2014, Pr. Andrew J. Oswald, Pr. Eugenio Proto, and Pr. Daniel Sgroi published the striking results of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/eproto/workingpapers/happinessproductivity.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;happy people were found to be 12% more productive, while unhappy workers proved 10% less productive.&lt;/strong&gt; According to the three economists, “human happiness has large and positive causal effects on productivity. Positive emotions appear to invigorate human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is true for individuals is all the more true for organizations. Companies that invest in employee support and satisfaction tend to succeed in fostering happier workers. And happy workers tend to work better with others, to have more energy, to be more creative, to fix problems instead of complaining about them, and to make better decisions overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof is in the profit. In 2005, Jerome Dodson, the founder of Parnassus Investments, added a new branch to his activities: the Parnassus Workplace Fund, a mutual fund that invests exclusively in large American firms proven to have &lt;strong&gt;outstanding workplaces, where employees are really happy.&lt;/strong&gt; The kinds of firms that “genuinely cared about their employees as people, not just hired hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodson scouted the country, not for the most promising companies, but for the companies that treated employees with profound respect and offered them ongoing training and personal development. Other criteria included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing a meaningful form of profit sharing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offering healthcare and retirement benefits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being supportive of working mothers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happiness pays!&lt;/strong&gt; To Dodson’s delight, the Parnassus Workplace Fund proved immediately, enormously, and enduringly successful. Since the fund’s inception and for 8 years, it “has had returns over 4% better than the S&amp;amp;P Index every year.” I’m sure we’d all like to get the same yield!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For those of you who are not familiar with market valuations, the Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s 500, is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies with common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. Now you know.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; study tells you that “only 13 percent of employees are engaged at work worldwide” it makes you wonder &lt;strong&gt;why happiness in the workplace isn’t a higher priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-boost-wellbeing-at-work&quot;&gt;How do you boost wellbeing at work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/building-joy-planning-plans.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sharing those results, you must be wondering: how can I boost employee engagement and happiness in my company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s good news and bad news. The bad news is: you cannot impose happiness on your employees. They have their share of responsibility in their own happiness. However, you can still set up ground rules and working conditions that will help your employees and teammates blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-a-culture-of-trust-and-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop a culture of trust and transparency…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… where your employees can share their doubts and flaws, ask questions, challenge one another.. Keeping people afraid of failing or of showing weakness is the best way to hinder creativity. Your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;show-gratitude-and-value-positive-intelligence&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show gratitude and value positive intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead by example. To set up a culture of gratitude and kindness, just display these qualities. If you are convincing enough, your teammates will follow your lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foster-empowerment-and-accountability&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foster empowerment and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stay engaged, a worker needs to feel that his job matters, and to be recognized for it. Empowering each individual to carry out his or her own tasks, and praising the results is the best way &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.teammood.com/engagement/tips/2013/07/30/how-to-improve-the-employee-engagement-with-these-5-great-tips.html&quot;&gt;to boost employee engagement&lt;/a&gt; – which doesn’t mean disparaging them should they need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;favor-breaks-and-downtime&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favor breaks and downtime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what most people may think, procrastination is actually good for productivity. While at ease, our brain enters its default mode and starts processing and sorting out information. These default mode phases are essential to our brain. Promoting &lt;strong&gt;breaks and relaxation will boost your teammates’ productivity and creativity.&lt;/strong&gt; It will also lower stress and frustration. Once again, I’d advise you to lead by example. Take a real lunch break and invite your teammates to join you. Take the time for coffee breaks and talk about anything but work. You can even set up a space to meditate, nap or do some yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;launch-a-wellness-program&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Launch a wellness program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up a healthy lunch or snacks program, sponsor gym membership, dedicate a room to yoga or fitness… Did you know that exercise actually stimulates endorphins (endorphins are neurotransmitters that induce a feeling of euphoria) (what better way to get happy?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s your turn to be creative. What are your top tips for improving well being at your workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/en/2016/10/05/moraleapp-is-shutting-down.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/en/2016/10/05/moraleapp-is-shutting-down.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 5th 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://moraleapp.com/shutdown&quot;&gt;MoraleApp announced that they are shutting down their service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a sad news for their users that have to look for an alternative but also for TeamMood who lose a pretty great competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, TeamMood has worked hard and it is now possible to migrate from MoraleApp to TeamMood seamlessly, without loosing your historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to import your MoraleApp data into TeamMood, just register there:

        <title>5 (Easy) Ways to Boost Team Productivity!</title>
        <link>http://blog.teammood.com/en/2016/01/12/5-ways-to-boost-team-productivity.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.teammood.com/en/2016/01/12/5-ways-to-boost-team-productivity.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As studies have shown time and time again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_study_shows/&quot;&gt;happy teams are productive teams&lt;/a&gt;. So if you want to boost your team’s productivity, team happiness is definitely one of the goals that you should be setting yourself. It’s not just a matter of teamwork. When people are happy­ they work better and faster, whether as a team &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/happiness-makes-your-brain-work-better.html&quot;&gt;or as individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you know how to boost your team’s productivity. Make them happy. How do you make them happy? Here are a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daily-meetings-contribute-to-wellbeing-at-work&quot;&gt;#1. Daily meetings contribute to wellbeing at work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily meetings (short daily meetings of course) are an excellent way to start off the day, and give your team a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These meetings should be open to all, meaning that any team member can speak their mind and offer their own opinion. They can bring their own ideas to the table, and feel that they have a real and tangible contribution to the team’s work, and the company’s success as a whole. When people are ‘engaged’ like this in the company’s decisions, they are more dedicated, and yes, happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/daily_meeting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Daily meeting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can also have these meetups in the middle of the day, as that creates a nice little break for your team, and they can have a breather before going on with the rest of their day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;track-their-mood&quot;&gt;#2. Track their mood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you should be aware of your team as individuals, tracking the mood of the entire team is invaluable. Of course if you see that one of your team members isn’t happy you should have a talk with them, and see if you can help them resolve any issues that they may be having, but being able to judge the overall mood of the team is an excellent way to head off any problems that might happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=5-easy-ways-to-boost-team-productivity&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_5-easy-ways-to-boost-team-productivity&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/teammood-main-en.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Track the mood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if people are becoming unhappy simply because they don’t have a coffee machine (and yes, we’ve seen that happen ☺), recognizing the fact that this is causing the entire team to underperform helps find a solution. In this case, it’s easy (just buy a coffee machine), but still – tracking the team’s mood is what helped find the underlying cause of the unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna try to follow the mood of your people, we have you covered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_content=5-easy-ways-to-boost-team-productivity&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_5-easy-ways-to-boost-team-productivity&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positive-feedback&quot;&gt;#3. Positive feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your team members to be happy and improve their wellbeing at work? Tell them you appreciate them! It is literally as simple as that. It’s amazing at how a few simple compliments – when deserved – will brighten someone’s day up, and turn them into a far happier (and productive) person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-how-to-prioritize&quot;&gt;#4. Show how to prioritize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if it’s the developers launching the product on time, the Sales team meeting their quota, or the IT guys getting through all their helpdesk tickets - Getting work done contributes to the team happiness. You can’t always do EVERYTHING, of course, but you can certainly get the most urgent stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/priority.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prioritiez&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how does the team to that? By prioritizing. But how does your team know what to prioritize? Is the login feature more important than the Facebook share feature? Is the negotiation with ACME company more important than finding a connection to &lt;a href=&quot;http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/Vandelay_Industries&quot;&gt;Vandelay Industries&lt;/a&gt;? That’s where you come in. As the team manager, it’s your job to help the team understand what is more important, so they can start clearing the workload off their desks, and yes, feel more accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delegation&quot;&gt;#5. Delegation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful teamwork – and one of the keys to happy teams – is delegation. You can’t do everything yourself, and you shouldn’t have to. Share responsibilities with your key workers, give tasks to individuals and share the workload in general with your team, and not only will it be easier for you to get your job done, they will feel more appreciated and trusted. And team members that feel like the team leader trusts them­ will try harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, you see that making people feeling better at the workplace can be pretty easily done.&lt;/p&gt;
