TeamMood started in 2017.

At the time, there were barely any tools like it.

But nowadays, employee survey tools all have pulse surveys that are similar to what TeamMood does.

However, these tools often fall into a common trap: feature overload.

In an attempt to increase usage and revenue, these tools are pushing more and more features to customers.

The consequence?

It alienates employees from giving feedback.

Here's a glimpse of the feature frenzy:

- Extensive analytics: engagement, retention, benchmarks, AI-powered sentiment analysis, and more
- Goal tracking
- Employee growth management
- 1-on-1 management
- Micro-learning â€” Showing small lessons to employees every day
- 360 feedback?!

Here's a list of recommended surveys we stumbled upon recently on a competitor's website.

1. Employee engagement surveys
2. Employee satisfaction surveys
3. Employee pulse surveys
4. Team effectiveness surveys
5. Candidate surveys
6. Onboarding surveys
7. 90-day probation period surveys
8. Exit surveys
9. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) surveys
10. Employee wellbeing surveys
11. Accountability surveys
12. Change surveys
13. Benefits surveys
14. Sustainability surveys

It's a noble goal to gather data for making the right decisions and ensuring everyone's happiness. But this approach quickly becomes an insurmountable obstacle to progress.

Because it's not just employees who suffer through all these surveys.

Managers face their own challenge: analysis paralysis.

With mountains of data from countless surveys and other tools, making sense of it all becomes a full-time job.

Hours are spent poring over complex dashboards and reports, trying to extract meaningful insights.

The irony?

All this data often leads to slower decision-making and delayed action.

By the time a conclusion is reached, the feedback might already be outdated.

That's why we keep TeamMood simple.

Our goal?

For your team to enjoy using TeamMood, and for you to get maximum value with minimal time investment.
