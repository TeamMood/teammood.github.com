Ever felt your heart race before a big meeting? Does the idea of conflict within your team keep you up at night?

You're not alone.

Anxiety in leadership is more common than you might think. And it's affecting how we lead our teams.

Why?

Well, it's a perfect storm:

- We're drowning in messages and calls
- Everyone seems to need something from us
- Our brains love to assume the worst
- We feel guilty if we don't reply RIGHT NOW

All these reasons lead you to hesitate when you need to make quick decisions. Or it could also lead you to micromanage your team, fearing things will fall apart if you don't.

Sound familiar?

But here's the thing: anxiety doesn't have to control you or your leadership.

## How to deal with anxiety and overwhelming responsibilities in a leadership position?

### 1. Manage your inbox, don't let it manage you

Start by setting specific times for checking emails – maybe once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

- Use folders or labels to prioritize messages.

- Archive less urgent messages.

- If you missed something truly urgent, trust that people will find another way to reach you.

### 2. Learn to delegate (it's okay, really!)

Delegation isn't just about offloading tasks – it's about empowering your team and freeing yourself to focus on what really matters.

- Start small.

- Pick a task you usually do, but that someone else could handle.

- Clearly explain what needs to be done, why it's important, and when it's due.

- Let go of perfectionism, it might not be done as perfectly as what you would do, but over time it will.

### 3. Embrace imperfection

Perfectionism is often the fast track to anxiety and burnout.

- Letting go of it isn’t just a solution for delegation, but something you should strive for in general.

- Start by setting realistic expectations for yourself and your team.

- When you make a mistake (and you will – we all do), own it. Use it as a learning opportunity.

- Your team isn't looking for a perfect leader – they're looking for an authentic one.

### 4. Challenge those anxious thoughts

Next time an anxious thought pops up, try this: Write it down.

Then, ask yourself, "Is this thought realistic? What evidence do I have for and against it?"

Often, you'll find your fears are overblown.

If the worry is valid, ask yourself, "What's the worst that could happen, and how would I handle it?”

### 5. Set boundaries for your well-being

Think of it as maintenance for your most important leadership tool: yourself.

- Start by identifying what truly recharges you.

- Maybe it's exercise, reading, or spending time in nature.

- Whatever it is, schedule it into your calendar like you would any other important meeting.

- Set boundaries to protect this time – it's not negotiable.

### **6. Use TeamMood to stay connected and reduce uncertainty**

Leadership anxiety often stems from not knowing how your team is really doing.

That's why TeamMood is also useful to control your anxiety.

By staying connected with your team's moods and concerns, you'll reduce uncertainty and be better equipped to address issues before they escalate.

Plus, you'll have concrete data to inform your decisions, easing that anxiety about making the right choices.
