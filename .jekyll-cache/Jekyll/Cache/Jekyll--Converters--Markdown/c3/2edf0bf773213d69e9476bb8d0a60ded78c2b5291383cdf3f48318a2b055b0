<p>Society, our bosses, and even Daft Punk tell us to work harder and be more productive, at any cost. In recent years, however, companies have begun to realize that <a href="https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html">productivity at any cost can be unproductive</a>. To remedy this, they have started to introduce greater flexibility and more perks at the office.</p>

<p>If you are on the same wavelength and eager to enhance the well-being at your office, here is our selection of exclusive tools and startups that you‚Äôll soon find indispensable.</p>

<h3 id="goodco--find-your-match">Good&amp;Co ‚Äì find your match</h3>

<p>The hiring process is always a sensitive subject for companies. It can be long and costly, especially if the candidate you end up hiring turns out not to be the right fit for the company. The best candidate is not just the smartest or the most creative person, but the one who best complements your company and your current employees, and who makes your team stronger ;)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://good.co/"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8-tools/good-co.png" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://good.co/">Good&amp;Co</a> is half matchmaker, half headhunter. Based on a proprietary psychometric algorithm, the platform helps job seekers identify their core strengths and professional persona, to assess whether they‚Äôll be a good fit for a company. As the founders say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only when a job feels like it was made for you that work feels less like work and more like play. Productivity and success follow naturally‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="noisli--boost-productivity--with-noise">Noisli ‚Äì boost productivity ‚Ä¶ with noise</h3>

<p>Did you know that noise can actually be better for productivity than total silence?</p>

<p>It may feel counter-intuitive, but studies show that productivity levels are higher when people are working in a coffee shop surrounded by a background buzz of conversation than in a quiet, empty room. But the level of noise has to be just right ‚Äì a bar playing Daft Punk as loud as in a club may not be so effective, with the exception being the writing of this article.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.noisli.com/"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8-tools/noisli.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.retrium.com/"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8-tools/retrium.png" /></a></p>

<h3 id="hivy--brings-happiness-to-your-workplace">Hivy ‚Äì brings happiness to your workplace</h3>

<p>What do coffee, notepads and a ping-pong table have in common? The same person in your company is probably responsible for buying all of  them, along with all the other everyday purchases for the office. Gathering requests and placing orders can be quite tedious  for your office manager or personal assistant or whoever is charged with the task.</p>

<p>This is where Hivy comes in. <a href="https://hivyapp.com/">Hivy</a> is an office management platform that creates a unique workplace experience. With a web and smartphone app or through a simple Slack command, all the wonderful people in your office can submit requests and make suggestions using Hivy. Office managers can handle their projects and manage the building within the app: get IT support, catering for an event, a cleaning company, etc.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://hivyapp.com/"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8-tools/hivy.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>And with all the material and snacks they need/want, your team members can relax and focus on getting their work done.</p>

<h3 id="exclusive-briq--much-more-than-a-thank-you">[Exclusive] Briq ‚Äì much more than a thank you</h3>

<p>The specialists have weighed in: wellbeing at work is strongly correlated with peer recognition, and even more so with personalized, public, and recurring recognition. But you can‚Äôt really orchestrate peer recognition within your company.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why the <a href="https://efounders.co/">eFounders</a>‚Äô team has created a peer recognition tool, Briq, that allows teammates to thank, to congratulate someone or to cheer someone up with a simple Slack command. The briqs you receive can be used through a set of applications: Bootiq, to buy goodies from the company shop (a company hoodie, a one-month, 6-month, or yearly subscription to Spotify or the gym, etc.), Snacky, to get a coffee or a snack, and much more. Employees can also receive briqs from the company itself, for instance when they share a corporate article on their personal social media, or when they refer someone for an open position.</p>

<p>Briq is conceived to adapt to each company‚Äôs needs and uses: you can personalize the applications and even build you own ones to incentivize actions that matter to your business.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.givebriq.com/"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8-tools/briq.png" /></a></p>

<p>What started as an internal tool just turned into a project all of its own. Briq is still in private beta, but you can grab an invite here: <a href="https://www.givebriq.com/">www.givebriq.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>
