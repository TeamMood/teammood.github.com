<p>One of the hardest part for a candidate is to get an overview of the teamâ€™s culture and how they feel at work. They have to trust the recruiter that the company is their best option, but is it really?</p>

<p>Robin, one of TeamMoodâ€™s customers, had difficulties to convince candidates to join his team. It was for an IT position, and the competition is tough to hire software engineers.</p>

<p>To better reflect the teamâ€™s culture and what teammates were really living on a daily basis, he showed his TeamMoodâ€™s data to the candidate.</p>

<p>The Robinâ€™s team is mainly happy, with some rough periods, as all teams have. But this level of transparency convinced the candidate to apply for the job in Robinâ€™s team.</p>

<p>Now, Robin systematically shows the TeamMoodâ€™s history to new candidates, so that they can see what happened and how it has been handled. No more bad surprises ;)</p>
