  <section class="post-content" data-cms-content-wrapper="/_layouts/post.html"><p>Around <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-core-beliefs-and-culture.pdf">88% of employees and 94% of executives</a> say that they believe company culture is crucial to success. If you want to create a powerful environment for your business, then you need to be willing to prize and prioritize the right ideas for your employees. For instance, one value worth cultivating is “gratitude”. Employees who are thankful for where they are and what they accomplish will constantly go above and beyond to serve their employers.</p>

<p>The question is, how do you bring a culture of gratitude into your workplace? The following steps could help.</p>

<h2 id="start-by-setting-an-example">1. Start by Setting an Example</h2>

<p>Whenever you want to implement a change in your company culture, the first thing you need to do is think about how you can set the right example. Remember, as the owner or manager of your business, you’re not just someone who cuts pay-checks and tells people what to do every day. You’re the leader that your employees turn to when they’re looking for advice and guidance.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/thanks.gif" alt="Showing gratitude" /></p>

<p>When people see you <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlsun/2017/12/18/how-to-create-a-culture-of-gratitude-in-the-workplace/">practicing gratitude every day</a>, they’ll start to embrace the concept as a natural part of your workplace culture. So, how do you bring gratitude into your life? That’s simple. All you need to do is start showing your appreciation for things - both little and big.</p>

<p>When someone accomplishes a task in your organization, show them how much you appreciate it by giving them a pat on the back. When you meet your goals or targets, share that with your team and show them how every success adds up in the long term. And more importantly, demonstrate <strong>the right values and behaviors</strong>, because that’s what matters the most in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="recognize-your-employees-in-the-way-they-prefer">2. Recognize Your Employees in the Way They Prefer</h2>

<p>Recognition is one of the most powerful things changing modern workforces. In fact, according to some studies, approximately <a href="http://www.workstars.com/recognition-and-engagement-blog/2017/08/18/10-knockout-employee-recognition-statistics-for-hr-infographic/">69% of employees</a> say that they would work harder and take on more responsibilities if they felt their efforts were appreciated. If you want to make sure that you’re building a culture of gratitude for your organization, start by thanking your employees for their hard work in a manner they can really resonate with.</p>

<p>For some small achievements, a simple “thank you” can be enough to make your staff feel better about their career. For bigger accomplishments, you might look for more significant ways to show your recognition. For instance, you could throw an office party celebrating a huge client win or share a company newsletter that highlights your top performers. Some organization still think that the “employee of the month” strategy works well as a way of keeping their hires happy too.</p>

<h2 id="give-your-people-reasons-to-be-thankful">3. Give Your People Reasons to be Thankful</h2>

<p>In a world where countless companies are beginning to explore ideas like remote working to help their employees tackle stress and workplace gyms for wellbeing, it pays to go above and beyond for your staff. If you want your employees to feel excited by the fact that they’re part of your team, and you’re hoping that your reputation as an excellent employer will spread to lure new talent to your company, then look for creative ways to make your staff smile.</p>

<p>The little extras and benefits you put into place to delight your team will depend on what they appreciate most. For instance, academic minds might like it if you sign them up for trips to regular conferences and training sessions. Plenty of employees like having an opportunity to expand and improve their skills. Providing this education not only makes your hires happy, but also gives you access to new talents too!</p>

<p>On the other hand, giving your employees a reason to be thankful could be as simple as signing them up for a <a href="https://www.javapresse.com/pages/subscriptions-gifts">monthly coffee subscription</a>, so that they can enjoy fresh java every day. This not only stops people from complaining about the stale drinks you previously had in your office kitchen, it also gives your team the antioxidants and great flavor they need to boost their mood and their productivity.</p>

<h2 id="look-for-ways-to-give-back">4. Look for Ways to Give Back</h2>

<p>Embracing a true culture of gratitude means more than giving something back to your employees. It could also mean that you look for ways to support your community and local causes that need your help. Signing up for a partnership with a charity that your team cares about and giving them paid leave to go and offer their services to that organization is a great way to share the idea of gratitude far and wide.</p>

<p>Collaborating with charities gives your employees an opportunity to express their gratitude for the privileges they enjoy as part of your company, and essentially share the wealth. As well as allowing staff to take part in formal programs, you could also ask employees to come up with and suggest their own initiatives. You’d be surprised how much a caring nature matters to today’s hires. Modern employees - particularly those in the millennial demographic, like to feel as though they’re having an impact on the world around them.</p>

<p>Showing your team that you’re willing to give something back both improves your culture of gratitude and may help you to attract new candidates to your company too.</p>

<h2 id="take-time-to-reflect">5. Take Time to Reflect</h2>

<p>Finally, sometimes the best way to nurture a culture of gratitude in your company is to simply slow down. When you stop rushing around after deadlines and take the time to stop and smell the coffee every now and again, it’s easier to reflect on where you are, and where you came from. Although running a business can be hard work, when you begin to reflect, you’ll realize just how lucky you’ve been so far.</p>

<p>Even in the toughest of times, most of us have something to be grateful for. Whether it’s a family back home that supports you or a great USP in your business, make sure that you appreciate what you have. Try to encourage moments of reflection for your team, so that they never lose sight of the positive things in their lives.</p>
