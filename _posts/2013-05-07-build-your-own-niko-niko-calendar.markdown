## Materials

You need:

* The calendar
* Some stickers
* A piece of paper

You can print some monthly calendars using this [free service](http://www.vertex42.com/calendars/printable-calendars.html).

Then, buy some stickers, take these ones for instance, which are available on [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/Color-Coding-Labels-Inches-Stickers/dp/B00DRGXBIM/) :

## Let's build it !

On the piece of paper, put the stickers with their meaning, for example :

* green: happy day
* yellow: good day
* orange: 
* red / pink: hard day

Just pin the calendar, with the stickers and the piece of paper at the exit of the team room.

## And now ?

Let each team member put a sticker on the calendar at the end of each working day, and voila !

But if you're too busy to build your own, take a look at our service : [TeamMood](http://www.teammood.com/en/niko-niko/), an easy way to get a glimpse of the happiness of your coworkers !
