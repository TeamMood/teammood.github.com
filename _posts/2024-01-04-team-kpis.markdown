Your primary goal is to ensure project success and team efficiency.

But amidst the maze of timelines, deliverables, and resource allocations, there's a critical element often overlooked: the happiness of your team.

Yet, it’s the cornerstone of your success as a manager.

- Research shows that happy teams are 20% more productive than their less happy counterparts.
- There’s also a staggering 41% decrease in absenteeism.
- The American Customer Satisfaction Index shows a direct link between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction.
- Happy teams, with higher retention rates, can significantly reduce these costs. And when replacing team members cost tens of thousands of dollars, it’s not a small reduction.
- Glassdoor's findings further accentuate the benefits: companies brimming with satisfied employees boast superior employer branding.
- A study by MIT reveals that teams reporting high satisfaction levels exhibit markedly improved collaboration.
- And it all leads to a 22% surge in profitability.

So, how do you gauge if your team members are genuinely fulfilled? The solution lies in defining the right team KPIs.

Here’s what this article will delve into:

- The common mistakes when choosing team KPIs
- Some examples of team KPIs with their pros and cons
- Why mood is the best KPI
- How to start tracking the mood of your team

## 8 common mistakes with team KPIs

Before we go into some examples of team KPIs, it’s important to know some of the mistakes that are easy to make with KPIs.

Because bad KPIs will create more problem than not having any KPIs at all. Imagine you’re not tracking the right indicator, it can make you double down on the wrong things. Not a good situation to be in.

**1/ Not aligning KPIs with business goals**

It's like having a map but not knowing your destination. KPIs should mirror your business objectives. Misalignment leads to chasing the wrong metrics.

To avoid this, regularly cross-check your KPIs with your overall business strategy. Ensure each KPI is a stepping stone towards your main goals.

**2/ Using too many KPIs**

Too many KPIs can cloud your focus. It's like trying to juggle too many balls at once – eventually, you'll drop one.

Limit KPIs to a manageable number that covers all critical areas without overlap. This way, you can concentrate on what truly matters without getting overwhelmed.

**3/ Setting unrealistic or unclear targets**

Setting goals too high or vague is like shooting an arrow in the dark.

Ensure your KPIs are achievable and crystal clear. Regularly review them to see if they're realistic and adjust if necessary.

Clear, attainable targets motivate your team to strive for success.

**4/** **Lack of communication and understanding**

If your team doesn't understand the KPIs, you’ll get some backlash for sure.

Involve your team in the KPI setting process and explain the rationale behind each one. This fosters a sense of ownership and clarity about what's expected.

**5/** **Not involving the team in setting KPIs**

Excluding your team from KPI discussions is like sailing without a crew. Involvement breeds commitment.

Encourage team input to ensure the KPIs are relevant and embraced by everyone.

**6/ Neglecting to regularly review and discuss KPIs**

KPIs aren't set-and-forget. They need regular check-ups, like a car needs servicing.

Review them periodically with your team to ensure they remain relevant and reflect current business needs.

**7/** **Using KPIs as a punishment tool**

Using KPIs to penalize rather than guide is counterproductive. It breeds fear, not motivation.

Use KPIs as a tool for growth and development, not as a stick to beat your team with.

**8/ Focusing solely on quantitative measures**

Quantitative KPIs are important, but they don't tell the whole story.

Include qualitative measures to get a fuller picture of your team's performance. It's about balancing numbers with narratives.

## Some examples of team KPIs

So now that you know more about what not to do with team KPIs, let’s see some of these KPIs.

Note that this section could be 5000 words long if we were detailing them all but like we said earlier, keeping things simple without too many KPIs is the right thing to do so we’ll only go for the main ones.

To help you find the right KPIs, we are adding situations when we think they’re useful and situations when we think it’s not.

By doing this with your current KPIs or the ones you are thinking about adding, it’ll be much easier to know if they’ll be useful in your context.

### **Productivity**

This is a classic one where you measure the the output of each team member over a given period.

- **Pros**: Directly correlates to business efficiency; easy to quantify.
- **Cons**: May not accurately reflect quality of work or team collaboration.
- **Valuable in**: High-output environments, such as manufacturing or sales.
- **Not as effective in**: Creative or R&D teams where quality and innovation are more important than quantity.

### **Customer satisfaction**

Gauges how satisfied customers are with a team's service or product, often measured through surveys.

- **Pros**: Direct feedback from customers; aligns team goals with customer needs.
- **Cons**: Subjective; can be influenced by factors outside the team’s control.
- **Valuable in**: Customer service, retail, and service-based industries.
- **Not as effective in**: Internal teams with no direct customer interaction.

### **Team turnover rate**

Measures the rate at which team members leave and need to be replaced.

- **Pros**: Indicates team stability and, indirectly, job satisfaction.
- **Cons**: High turnover might be due to factors beyond the team's control.
- **Valuable in**: All industries, as a general health check of team environment.
- **Not as effective in**: Industries with naturally high turnover rates, like hospitality.

### **Project completion rate**

Measures the rate at which the team completes projects or tasks on time.

- **Pros**: Clearly shows efficiency and effectiveness in meeting deadlines.
- **Cons**: Can lead to rushed work if deadlines are overly prioritized.
- **Valuable in**: Project-based environments like IT, construction, and marketing.
- **Not as effective in**: Continuous, non-project-based roles.

### **Absenteeism rate**

Tracks the frequency and duration of unscheduled absences.

- **Pros**: Highlights potential issues with engagement or workplace environment.
- **Cons**: High rates can be due to legitimate health concerns or external factors.
- **Valuable in**: All industries, for monitoring team health and morale.
- **Not as effective in**: Roles with flexible work arrangements or remote work.

### **Employee engagement level**

Measures the level of commitment and motivation among team members, often through surveys.

- **Pros**: Indicates team morale and potential for productivity.
- **Cons**: Subjective and influenced by many external factors.
- **Valuable in**: All industries, particularly in knowledge-based and creative roles.
- **Not as effective in**: Situations where engagement is difficult to measure or influence.

Here are a few others you might find useful:

- Revenue per wmployee
- Quality of work
- Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)
- Team utilization rate

## Lagging vs leading KPIs

The problem with a lot of these commonly used KPIs is that they are often lagging indicators. If productivity is low, it’s already too late. Same with absenteeism rate, turnover rate, customer satisfaction, etc.

That’s why in your KPIs, you absolutely need a leading indicator. It’s an indicator that is a predictor of the problems to come.

Employee engagement level is one. If it drops, it’s indicative that productivity and other lagging indicators will also drop soon, but it gives you time to correct course before it impacts the team and eventually the business too much.

## Team mood as a KPI

The best KPI to measure your team's well-being is actually its mood.

But aiming for perfect moods isn't the goal. It will only create unrealistic expectations.

Mood is subjective, and each individual perceives their happiness differently. Thus, using an absolute value for mood is nonsensical.

The key is to track mood's relative value over time. This approach recognizes individual differences and focuses on trends rather than absolute figures.

It's a sensitive barometer for the team's overall temperature and is a great an early indicator of potential issues that need addressing.
