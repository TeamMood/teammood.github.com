    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you search the Web for resources about entrepreneurship, (lean)startup and so on, you'll find a lot of articles and advices, but it is very hard to know how to begin, and what's could be your next move.</p>

<p>I don't remember how I get on this when I was doing some research for my <a href="http://teammood.com">TeamMood project</a>, but I found an awesome gold nugget : <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a></p>

<p><a href="http://startitup.co"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/startitup.png" title="" ></a></p>

<p>Based on the Lean Startup, it helps me lot with valuable advices, and a lot of articles containing several samples.</p>

<p>It is very simple to use : you go through the step by step guide, answer some questions about your idea/team/competition etcâ€¦ and it progressively builds your Lean Canvas and helps you to structure your mind.</p>

<p>Also note that these guys are expecting a lot of feedback, and they are super reactive.</p>

<p>So if you have an idea, and you don't know where to start, go on <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a> !</p>
