The [Niko-niko calendar](/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html) is an Agile practice which aims to detect patterns of change of mood of a team over time.

The technic is very easy: at the end of the day, each team member paste a sticker on a calendar to tell if he had a good day at work.
<!--base32-9nqq4t8-base32-->

In other word, you probably ever went back to home from work and feel that you had a bad day, or you did not feel "productive". That's a red sticker.

After some time, you'll see some color being dominant, it will give an insight of the mood of the team.

It is a good idea to take a look at the Niko-niko calendar during the [Agile retrospective](https://www.teammood.com/en/agile-retrospective-tools-ideas/).

It is not exact science, it is just a simple tool to get some [more informations about the team](/2019/03/29/why-doing-team-health-checks.html).

The Niko-niko calendar is also know as "happiness index". Also note that "niko" means "smile" in the japanese language.

The first mention of the Niko-niko calendar is from an [article from Akinori SAKATA in 2006](http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html){: target="_blank"}.
