Thanks to contributions from some of our power users ([Nathaniel Richand](https://twitter.com/nrichand) and [Guillaume Patry](https://twitter.com/guillaume_patry)), it is now possible to display the latest moods of your team on your monitoring display in real time.

They wrote widgets for [Dashing](http://dashing.io/) and [Smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing), a great and easy to use free dashboard frameworks.

The TeamMood widgets look like this:
