The world of work has undergone a seismic shift in recent years, with the rise of hybrid and remote teams becoming the new norm. While this transition has brought with it numerous benefits, such as increased flexibility and productivity, it has also highlighted the importance of employee well-being. These days, it’s important that companies prioritize the well-being of their employees to ensure that they are able to perform at their best and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

## Key Factors for Employee Well-being

There are numerous factors that can influence an employee's well-being, some are more significant than others.

- **Workload**: The workload plays a crucial role in an employee's well-being. An excessive workload can lead to stress, exhaustion, and burnout. Employers should ensure that their employees are not overburdened with work and have enough time to rest and recover.
- **Motivation**: Motivated employees are more likely to be productive and satisfied with their work. Employers should provide their employees with opportunities for growth and development to keep them motivated and engaged.
- **Job/task clarity**: Clear job descriptions and well-defined tasks can help employees understand their roles and responsibilities. This can help reduce confusion, stress, and anxiety, ultimately leading to better employee well-being.
- **Social Interaction**: A positive work environment that fosters social interaction can significantly improve an employee's well-being. Employers should encourage team building activities, social events, and provide opportunities for employees to interact with each other.
- **Ability to learn and room for experimentation**: Employees who have the opportunity to learn and experiment with new skills and ideas are more likely to be satisfied with their work. Employers should provide opportunities for employees to develop their skills, try new things, and grow professionally.
- **Autonomy**: Employees who have autonomy over their work are more likely to feel in control and satisfied with their work. Employers should provide employees with the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of their work.
- **Environment**: A healthy work environment that is safe, comfortable, and clean can significantly contribute to employee well-being. Employers should ensure that their workspaces are well-maintained and provide ergonomic equipment and furniture.

## How 1:1s can help identify issues with employee well-being

1:1 meetings can be an effective tool for identifying issues with employee well-being. During these meetings, managers can check in with employees, discuss their work, and gain insight into their emotional and mental state.

### Prerequisite: build trust

First, it’s important to create a safe space for open and non-judgemental communication. The team member should be comfortable to share their thoughts and concerns, without negative consequences. It may take some time before you’ve reached a certain level of trust, before the team member can be fully open and transparent. Therefore, it’s important to do 1:1s regularly, like weekly or bi-weekly.

Once you’ve gained enough trust, you can dig into the well-being of the team member. We’ve listed a handful of questions for each key factor of employee’s well-being that you can use in your next one-on-one meeting.

### Questions about workload and job/task clarity

1. How do you feel about your current workload? Do you feel like you have too much, too little, or just the right amount of work?
2. Are there any specific tasks or projects that are causing you stress or taking up more time than expected?
3. Is there anything you need from me or the team to better manage your workload or feel more supported?
4. Do you feel like you have a clear understanding of your job responsibilities and how they contribute to the team/company's overall goals?
5. Are there any tasks or projects that you feel unsure about or could use more clarification on?

### Questions about motivation and social interaction

1. What motivates you the most in your work?
2. Is there anything I can do to help support your motivation, such as providing feedback, recognition, or other forms of support?
3. Are there any team-building activities or events that you would like to see implemented to improve social interaction?
4. Do you have any feedback on the current work environment or physical layout of the office that may be affecting social interaction?

### Questions about ability to learn and experiment, and autonomy

1. Are there any new skills or technologies that you are interested in learning to help you improve your day-to-day work?
2. Have you had the opportunity to experiment with new approaches or processes in your work recently? If so, how did that go? If not, what is holding you back?
3. Is there anything that you would like to experiment with or try out in your work, but haven't had the chance to yet?
4. Is there anything that you think the team or company could do to encourage more learning and experimentation among employees?
5. How do you feel about the level of autonomy you have in your work?

### Questions about work environment

1. How do you feel about the current work environment, such as the physical workspace, noise levels, lighting, and temperature?
2. Are there any changes you would suggest to improve the work environment, such as rearranging the workspace, adding plants or artwork, or adjusting the temperature or lighting?
3. Have you noticed any environmental factors that are affecting your productivity or well-being, such as distractions or discomfort?
4. Are there any tools or resources that you feel are missing from the work environment that could help you be more productive or comfortable, such as better technology or ergonomic furniture?
5. Is there anything that you think the team or company could do to improve the overall work environment, such as implementing flexible work arrangements, creating more collaborative spaces, or providing wellness programs?
