        <title>How To Implement Positive Management As A Game-changer For Your Company</title>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/05/15/how-to-implement-positive-management-as-a-game-changer-for-your-company.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre reading this blog, you are probably aware of the &lt;strong&gt;benefits of fostering &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;well-being in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in terms of employee engagement and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note that we talk about well-being rather than happiness, which would be rather presumptuous as happiness depends on a number of factors that companies and managers cannot control).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you know how to make it happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve gathered &lt;strong&gt;our best resources&lt;/strong&gt; to guide you through this change. Follow the lead!¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adapting-your-hiring-process&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapting your hiring process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts with hiring the right person for the right job. And I‚Äôm not talking about competencies only. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2019/02/19/hire-for-culture-fit-not-competencies.html&quot;&gt;Culture fit&lt;/a&gt; is one of the key criteria ‚Äì if not the most important ‚Äì to infuse a feeling of belonging to your team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, you‚Äôll need to pay attention to the expectations of your candidates. Motivation drivers have evolved over the years, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html&quot;&gt;hiring millennials&lt;/a&gt; can be challenging for managers who don‚Äôt understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once you‚Äôve found the perfect candidate, why not trying the transparency card and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/convincing-candidates-to-join-your-team.html&quot;&gt;sharing the actual mood of your team&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;managing-for-the-well-being-of-your-teammates&quot;&gt;Managing for the well-being of your teammates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-being at work depends on a number of factors you (as a manager) should always keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/recognition/workplace/tips/2013/10/21/the-importance-of-employee-recognition-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;employee recognition&lt;/a&gt; a pillar of your management style&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/engagement/tips/2013/07/30/how-to-improve-the-employee-engagement-with-these-5-great-tips.html&quot;&gt;employee engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/05/dare-benevolent-leadership.html&quot;&gt;benevolent leadership style&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/11/29/dont-fall-in-the-trap-of-micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;micromanaging&lt;/a&gt; your team members&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/how-to-encourage-work-life-balance-at-work.html&quot;&gt;work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and all the perks you can implement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/09/26/10-easy-ways-to-improve-the-mood-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;improve the mood in the workplace&lt;/a&gt; (we listed 10 of the best ideas we found).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-conflicts&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the perfect company cannot avoid dissatisfaction and conflicts. However, managers can make a difference by identifying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html&quot;&gt;signs of underlying conflict&lt;/a&gt; early on, and not letting the situation escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If like many managers you feel helpless when conflicts arise, we‚Äôve crafted a 5-step guide to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2017/06/29/how-to-defuse-conflicts-at-work-in-5-steps.html&quot;&gt;defusing conflicts at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-the-right-tools&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the right tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benevolent managers need their toolbox too! Tools to better manage projects, to learn from failures and successes, to say thank you‚Ä¶ You can dig in our own selection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2017/05/23/8-exclusive-tools-to-make-your-teammates-happier-at-work.html&quot;&gt;tools to make your teammates happier at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to measure the positive impact of all these changes on your teammates, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;measure your team‚Äôs health with a Niko-niko calendar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Convincing Candidates To Join Your Team</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/convincing-candidates-to-join-your-team.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/convincing-candidates-to-join-your-team.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You screened hundreds of CVs, had a lot of recruitment interviews, presented her‚Ä¢him to the team, negotiated the offer, and you finally found the perfect candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But s‚Ä¢he is having second thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/angry-meme-transparent-png.png&quot; alt=&quot;A recruiter after learning that the candidate has second thoughts&quot; title=&quot;A recruiter after learning that the candidate has second thoughts&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest part for a candidate is to get an overview of the team‚Äôs culture and how they feel at work. They have to trust the recruiter that the company is their best option, but is it really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/joinus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A trusty recruiter&quot; title=&quot;A trusty recruiter&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teammood-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;TeamMood To The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin, one of TeamMood‚Äôs customers, had difficulties to convince candidates to join his team. It was for an IT position, and the competition is tough to hire software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better reflect the team‚Äôs culture and what teammates were really living on a daily basis, he showed his TeamMood‚Äôs data to the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-analytics-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;TeamMood analytics&quot; title=&quot;TeamMood analytics&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Robin‚Äôs team is mainly happy, with some rough periods, as all teams have. But this level of transparency convinced the candidate to apply for the job in Robin‚Äôs team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Robin systematically shows the TeamMood‚Äôs history to new candidates, so that they can see what happened and how it has been handled. No more bad surprises ;)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Encourage Work-Life Balance at Work</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/how-to-encourage-work-life-balance-at-work.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/how-to-encourage-work-life-balance-at-work.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stress and burnout have become an increasing phenomenon worldwide over the last decade. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virgin.com/disruptors/infographic-how-stressed-are-uk-employees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouGov survey&lt;/a&gt;, 51% of full-time UK employees said they have experienced anxiety or burnout in their current job. In France, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ringover.com/en/blog/burnout-the-epidemic-of-the-century&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;53% of employees and 68% of managers find their job too stressful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation seems contradictory with the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;happy employees are more productive&lt;/a&gt; than unhappy ones. If someone‚Äôs health is his or her own responsibility, employers have an important part to play in their employees‚Äô well-being. Here are &lt;strong&gt;7 policies you can implement to help your team members achieve work-life balance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-a-flexible-work-schedule-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Implementing a flexible work schedule policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every employee works differently, some intrinsically tend to concentrate better in the morning, others are more productive at night. Setting up a fixed work schedule forces team members to adapt their natural cycle to the company, creating stress in their own body up to a feeling of imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents may need to leave early from work in order to fetch their kids from daycare or school. Other collaborators may want to go play squash during their lunch break or attend a yoga session after work. Whatever their reason, favoring a flexible work schedule will help your employees better respect their own needs. As a result, they will feel more relaxed at work, increasing their focus and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encouraging-work-life-balance-flexible-work-scheduleuploadsteammood-work-life-balance-1png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: Flexible work schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offering-partial-or-full-remote-working-to-your-employees&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Offering partial or full remote working to your employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going every day to the office makes employees spend time telecommuting. Depending on where they live, the number of hours wasted can sum up absurdly at the end of the year. And the stress generated by the hours spent behind the wheel stuck in traffic is highly unproductive too. Likewise, some employees may decide to go and work in a big city in order to get a job, while dreaming to live on the opposite side of the country, or even abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of employees favor flexibility at work ‚Äì especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html&quot;&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt;. Letting your employees decide where they want to work greatly participates in helping them find their own balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: remote working&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favoring-lunch-and-coffee-breaks&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Favoring lunch and coffee breaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some managers and hard workers still consider breaks as time wasted on their work day. On the contrary! Our brain works like a muscle: it needs training, but also resting and key nutrients, including oxygen and water. You can‚Äôt just make it operate at full capacity for hours without taking a break. At some point, your productivity and creativity will inevitably decrease, losing the benefits of the few minutes you ‚Äúsaved‚Äù earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.buffer.com/science-taking-breaks-at-work/&quot;&gt;Courtney Seiter from Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, breaks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keep us from getting bored, thus increase our focus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help us retain information and make connections ‚Äì which automatically increases our creativity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give us the opportunity to reevaluate our goals and reorder our priorities of the day/week/year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can choose your own way to take a break: going for lunch with your colleagues, exercising, going some meditation, taking a quick nap after lunch, reading a book‚Ä¶ The key is to listen to your body and look after yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: lunch and coffee breaks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-culture-of-efficiency-rather-than-workload&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Setting up a culture of efficiency rather than workload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you rather see your employees work long hours but wasting time throughout the day, or be focused, and leave early from the office? One can hardly be efficient for 10 or 12 hours in a row. Plus we all have different capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentivizing your team members to producing great results rather than working long hours will motivate them to get the job done and use their free time as they wish. It‚Äôs a win-win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: Efficiency rather than workload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freeing-up-your-holiday-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Freeing up your holiday policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering paid time off is crucial to let your employees rest, take their mind off work, recharge their batteries. This essential break gives a true breath that lulls them into a state of serenity before jumping back in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering a generous vacation policy is one of the many ways you can show your employees gratitude. And if you want to go a step further, you can follow ZenPayroll example and opt for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themuse.com/advice/unlimited-vacation-policy-what-you-should-know&quot;&gt;unlimited vacation policy&lt;/a&gt;. The huge plus? &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIt helps build an ownership mentality‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; according to Joshua Reeves, their CEO and co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful though, when offered unlimited vacations, some employees may end up taking fewer days off. At Basecamp, to counter this perverse effect, employees are offered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/basecamp-ceo-says-hes-running-out-of-perks-2017-6&quot;&gt;financial package to go on holidays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: Free up your holiday policy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;helping-new-parents&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Helping new parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you believe that in the 21st century, offering paternity leave is still not obvious for a majority of companies? The capitalist model tends to forget that a good part of the world‚Äôs equilibrium is based on free ‚Äúwork‚Äù: having kids and raising them. Take it away and the whole economy collapses, more surely than if a war breaks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New parents bear this incredible responsibility in addition to their work. And everything that their company can implement to ease their job will make their lives a little bit smoother: offering flexible schedules, extending paternity leave, creating a daycare center for the company or booking some spots in an exterior structure‚Ä¶ Your employees will definitely feel grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: Helping new parents&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encouraging-sports-activities-and-meditation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Encouraging sports activities and meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the risks of working long hours is to prevent yourself from getting enough exercise. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-exercising-makes-us-happier&quot;&gt;activities can make you happier, give you more energy and help you gain focus&lt;/a&gt;. By offering flexible working hours, dedicating a room for working out, sponsoring a gym membership, or creating a small bathroom to take a shower after a run at lunchtime, you can encourage your employees to take the time to exercise, for the sake of their mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, meditation has proven highly beneficial to relax your brain and lower stress. If your office has an empty room, you can consider turning it into a meditation room that your employees can use throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/teammood-work-life-balance-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encouraging work-life balance: sport activities and meditation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all this will have no impact if you don‚Äôt set the example yourself. Change needs to come from the leadership, translated into values and policies, and implemented at every level of the company. Work-life balance must be at the core of your company if you want it to truly improve the wellbeing of your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why doing Team Health Checks?</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/29/why-doing-team-health-checks.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/29/why-doing-team-health-checks.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;importance-of-a-team-health-check&quot;&gt;Importance of a team health check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great success and achievements do not come overnight, and are rarely the result of a person alone, but rather by a group of individuals what we commonly call a ‚Äúteam‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/proverb-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Why doing Team Health Checks&quot; title=&quot;Why doing Team Health Checks&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to work together, as a true team, is far better than the expertise of each individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-makes-a-team-great&quot;&gt;But what makes a team great?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Google did &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/&quot;&gt;its own research&lt;/a&gt; and found these 5 characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Structure &amp;amp; clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we‚Äôre doing matters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Team Health Check&lt;/strong&gt; is a great way to take the temperature of a team. And that‚Äôs a starting point for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-of-a-team-health-check&quot;&gt;Goals of a Team Health Check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing regular checks, teams should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase trust and psychological safety within the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have better relationships between teammates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a culture of constructive criticism and feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raise issues and fix them quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share their feelings more easily and frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/meditation-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keep your team zen thanks to regular Team Health Checks&quot; title=&quot;Keep your team zen thanks to regular Team Health Checks&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-do-a-team-health-check&quot;&gt;How to do a Team Health Check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to run a Team Health Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-a-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;Use a Niko-Niko Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;Niko-Niko Calendar&lt;/a&gt; is a simple calendar with everybody‚Äôs name on it. At the end of the day, each team member is invited to share their mood of the day, sticking smilies happy :-), straight :-, or frowning :-( or color stickers on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-an-emotional-seismograph-with-the-team&quot;&gt;Create an Emotional Seismograph with the team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During, one of your retrospectives, try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/10/30/the-emotional-seismograph-a-fun-and-effective-retrospective-format.html&quot;&gt;Emotional Seismograph&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs an easy and fun way to get an overview of your team health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-team-health-check-like-spotify&quot;&gt;Run Team Health Check like Spotify&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Team Health Check has been popularized by Spotify with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/&quot;&gt;Squad Health Check model&lt;/a&gt;, where people are asked to score 11 different areas (Easy to release, Suitable process, Tech quality, Value, Speed, Mission, Fun, Learning, Support, Pawns or players) on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;green: good&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;yellow: some problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;red: really bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;suggest-improvements-from-a-team-health-check&quot;&gt;Suggest improvements from a Team Health Check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proposed by Aaron Gallagher from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/team-temp-aka-health-check-aaron-gallagher/&quot;&gt;his article about Team Health Check&lt;/a&gt;, you can combine a Team Health Check with a Perfection Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Äú[During a Perfection Game], people have to rate the value that they received on a scale from 1 to 10, based on how much value they think they could add themselves by improving the product or service. For example, when there is nothing that they think they can improve, they should rate with a 10. If they think that they could make it twice as valuable, they should give it a 5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If somebody rates the value as 5, (s)he will have to provide suggestions on how to make it a 10. People can only withhold points if they provide suggestions to improve it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From Ben Linders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benlinders.com/2014/getting-feedback-with-the-perfection-game/&quot;&gt;https://www.benlinders.com/2014/getting-feedback-with-the-perfection-game/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from a Team Health Check, Aaron proposes to think about what we could do so that people would feel better in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-turn&quot;&gt;Your turn!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm still amazed by the fact that however simple the concept of Team Health Check is, it‚Äôs still rarely used by team leaders. So, start now with your first Team Health Check, and if you fall in love with it, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt; to do it on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/dance-the-music-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Run your first Team Health Check, and be amazed!&quot; title=&quot;Run your first Team Health Check, and be amazed!&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dare Benevolent Leadership!</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/05/dare-benevolent-leadership.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/05/dare-benevolent-leadership.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a translation of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/osez-le-management-bienveillant-julien-rigoulay/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;French article&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienrigoulay/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Julien Rigoulay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Benevolent leadership is a concept at the heart of discussions in companies that want to innovate and boost productivity. Initially seen as naive or just a trend following on from the humanist movement, benevolence in the workplace is now considered a ‚Äústrong lever‚Äù for attracting employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;With the massive retirement of the baby boom generation, wage portage, and young executives increasingly attracted by positions abroad, the current context forces companies to review their management style. Indeed, in order to recruit reliable and motivated employees, companies must adopt a different, more ethical and attractive policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;This is where benevolence comes into play: it breaks the hierarchical structure that reflects aggressive practices in the corporate world. When each individual feels at ease in their work environment, they become more productive and feel more involved. But before we go any further, let‚Äôs take a closer look at this concept to make it really beneficial for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;benevolent-leadership-what-is-it-exactly&quot;&gt;Benevolent leadership, what is it exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;To boil it right down, here are the main points that make the difference in a benevolently-managed company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;inviting-collaborators-to-take-part-in-major-decisions&quot;&gt;Inviting collaborators to take part in major decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;When managers promote discussion around major decisions within their company, they empower their team members. This is an effective strategy to make employees feel more involved. Indeed, when each individual feels that they are contributing to the company‚Äôs development, it creates attachment. Note that management itself doesn‚Äôt have to be collaborative, but discussion is always important before making any major decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;adopting-a-caring-attitude-and-always-being-attentive&quot;&gt;Adopting a caring attitude and always being attentive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;A manager who‚Äôs not afraid to smile is like a breath of fresh air in the workplace. Not only does it make team members more relaxed, but it also makes them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/en/get-feedback/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more likely to share crucial information should a problem arise&lt;/a&gt;, helping to reach a resolution more quickly. Indeed, a stern-faced manager can put employees off from sharing their thoughts.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs also vital for managers to have good listening skills. Not only is the information provided by the teams always important for making good decisions, but their active participation also motivates them. When a manager pays attention and acts on the recommendations of a team member, the latter will feel more motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;a-benevolent-manager-but-no-cronyism&quot;&gt;A benevolent manager, but no ‚Äúcronyism‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;To be a good manager, you have to treat all your employees equally. Indeed, benevolence does not mean being ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù with everyone. We must not lose sight of the ultimate aim: to serve the interests of the company. To achieve this, the manager must manage team members equally without playing favourites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;recognizing-that-mistakes-happen-and-promoting-communication&quot;&gt;Recognizing that mistakes happen and promoting communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Employees learn and forge themselves in part by making mistakes. A benevolent manager must accept that to err is human and recognize that people are bound to mess up from time to time. This kind of mindset fosters confidence within a team by taking the pressure off and promoting a good atmosphere at work. However, benevolence does not mean that there are no consequences, but they must be proportional to the mistake made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Communication plays a vital role in benevolent management. A manager with strong communication skills can share information or announce decisions with ease. For example, if salary increases are to reflect individual performance, this detail must be communicated from the beginning. That being said, it will be easier for the manager to explain if some team members don‚Äôt get an increase. However, bad news must always be announced with respect and finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;how-to-manage-with-kindness&quot;&gt;How to manage with kindness?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Although the concept of benevolent leadership is on the lips of business leaders and heads of department everywhere, it seems to be little more than a good intention. Indeed, most who try to implement it tend to forget that it requires a real implementation plan. A profound change must be made in order to get results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Company leaders must define a new management approach, possibly with the help of a specialized coach. The organization must also evolve to promote benevolence within the company while respecting the specificities of the company. A dynamic and solid balance must be created and maintained within a positive environment that promotes efficiency and energy. Here are some recommendations that will help you achieve a genuine transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;the-process-must-be-global&quot;&gt;The process must be global&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;The project must come from the top of the hierarchy and encompass each and every one of the company‚Äôs departments and teams. Indeed, if benevolent management is practiced by only one manager, it won‚Äôt affect the whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Benevolence needs to be more than just a Human Resources Department project. It must become a source of motivation for each individual. Employees need to be involved and motivated to help managers move forward, especially in times of crisis. Indeed, when teams are loyal, there is less turnover: the presence of each individual contributes to the smooth overall running of the company and boosts productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot; id=&quot;every-employee-counts&quot;&gt;Every employee counts¬†&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;The concept of corporate benevolence implies that a radically individual-oriented policy be established. Each person must feel useful and special. The professional and personal lives of every team member matters. Some leaders think that giving more time to the personal life of an employee will make him or her less productive. On the contrary! If managers give more importance to employees‚Äô personal life and well-being, they will be more productive.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Fostering this perspective requires managers who know how to listen. When an employee makes an effort, they must be recognized for their true value. This encourages them to be more creative and to feel more involved in the company life, which automatically fosters a feeling of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/candidates-choose-jobs-company-culture.aspx&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1551799259820000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE0IoSYdUT4c6-ZTb9PW72EXdbyow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that over the next decade, it‚Äôs the candidates who will choose which company they want to work for rather than the other way around. Managers will have to set up a recruitment system that attracts the profiles they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many changes have to be made before benevolent leadership can become more than just a good intention. The outdated practices of previous generations will no longer suffice. If companies fail to adapt their approach, productivity will decline. Balance has become all important in the employee-company relationship: managers will have to step up their efforts to implement benevolence if they want to grow company profits!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hire for Culture Fit, Not Competencies</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2019/02/19/hire-for-culture-fit-not-competencies.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2019/02/19/hire-for-culture-fit-not-competencies.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the relentlessly competitive global climate, the key to success in business isn‚Äôt what you do but how you do it. Providing the best product or service isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äì you need to differentiate yourself from the competition at team, department and company level. But how? That‚Äôs where your company culture can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aligning-your-culture-and-brand&quot;&gt;Aligning your culture and brand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong, differentiated company culture contributes to a strong, differentiated brand that will attract both customers and employees. Examples vary from one company to the next: offering generous employee benefits such as free drinks at Starbucks, encouraging employees to disagree with their managers at Amazon, empowering employees to be their own boss at Zappos, letting people set their own hours at Patagonia, unlimited vacation or no tracking policy at Netflix‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs obvious that if you want to win the battle for customers, your culture and brand need to be aligned and driven by a common purpose and set of values. And it all starts with recruitment.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-you-should-hire-for-culture-fit-over-skill-set&quot;&gt;4 reasons you should hire for culture fit over skill set&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lower-turnover&quot;&gt;Lower turnover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably want to be surrounded by the best ‚Äì that‚Äôs par for the course. But ‚Äúthe best‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Äúthe most qualified‚Äù or ‚Äúthe candidate with the best degree‚Äù. In fact, hiring top performers that don‚Äôt fit your company culture is a recipe for unhappy employees that won‚Äôt adjust to your organization or get along with their teammates. In the end, they will stagnate in their position until they find a better one elsewhere. This kind of bad fit is the reason why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/01/23/89-of-new-hires-fail-because-of-their-attitude/#56acdf3f137a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50% of new hires fail in the first 18 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-feeling-of-belonging&quot;&gt;A feeling of belonging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating a highly qualified person who doesn‚Äôt fit your company culture will be more challenging than making a success of hiring a ¬†good match for your company culture with a more average skill set. They will always feel like outsiders and integrating them will represent a considerable challenge. On the other hand, fitting in with your company culture gives your employees a feeling of belonging, thereby increasing their loyalty to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-smarter-bet-in-the-long-run&quot;&gt;A smarter bet in the long run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;growth versus fixed mindset model&lt;/a&gt;, put forth by psychologist Carol Dweck? It basically states that education should value effort over result in order to help us enjoy the process of learning about new topics and acquiring new skills. Giving too much importance to your employees‚Äô skill set or achievements on the day you recruit them may not encourage them to be curious and explore new areas in the future. In our rapidly changing business landscape, it won‚Äôt be long before they start lagging behind. Choosing a candidate for his or her potential instead is the smarter bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increased-collaboration&quot;&gt;Increased collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring a highly qualified person who doesn‚Äôt fit with your company culture can jeopardize the whole company‚Äôs equilibrium. Indeed, ‚Äúunity is strength‚Äù is only valid when people actually want to work together. Team members that share the same values will get along better, improving team spirit and overall collaboration inside the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring for culture fit involves defining your company, department or team culture first: the values, implicit rules, and interactions among employees that differentiate your tribe from any other organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ùóBe careful not to confuse the lack of diversity with culture fit. Diversity is vital to your company‚Äôs ability to innovate and adapt to an ever-evolving environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you defined your company/department/team culture? Do you leverage it in your hiring process? Tell us in the comments ¬†section :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don‚Äôt fall in the trap of micromanagement!</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/11/29/dont-fall-in-the-trap-of-micromanagement.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/11/29/dont-fall-in-the-trap-of-micromanagement.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every employee needs guidance and direction in order to translate the company‚Äôs vision and strategy in his‚Ä¢her day to day job. That‚Äôs where managers play a key role ‚Äì and good ones can really make a difference in an organization. Issues arise when someone shifts from managing to micromanaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-micromanagement&quot;&gt;What is micromanagement?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromanagement occurs when, instead of giving general instructions and supervising only the approach and the overall objective, the manager follows and evaluates every step of the project, failing to delegate to his‚Ä¢her subordinates or employees the responsibility they should bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromanagers tend to obsess on every little detail of everything instead of looking at the big picture. They are overly critical and controlling and push aside the qualification and experience of others. They are petty dictators and constantly interfere with their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate world is littered with such micromanagers. According to American consultant Harry Chambers, author of the book &lt;em&gt;My Way or the High¬≠way‚Äâ: The Micro¬≠mana¬≠gement Survival Guide&lt;/em&gt;, nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getabstract.com/en/summary/leadership-and-management/my-way-or-the-highway/4658/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8 out of 10 employees report that they work for micromanagers or have in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-managers-micromanage&quot;&gt;Why do managers micromanage?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers who tend to micromanage do so for different reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An attention to detail taken to the extreme;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Their incompetence;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Their insecurity and lack of self-esteem, or even some kind of malignant narcissism or the expression of an obsessive-compulsive disorder;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External pressure (organizational culture, pressure on delay and performance, instability of the job, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A managerial tactic in order to make an unwanted employee leave.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behavior is found more specifically with intermediary managers, who are being stranded between the high expectations of their boss and the pressure of their team members and tend to lose control of the situation little by little and take refuge in an oppressive behavior for others and themselves. In fact, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter principle&lt;/a&gt;, the more you progress within your company, the more you‚Äôll face such managers who‚Äôve reached their ‚Äúlevel of incompetence‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-damaging-effects-of-micromanagement&quot;&gt;The damaging effects of micromanagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/quote-steve-jobs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of micromanagement are immediate for the company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-overall-productivity-decreases&quot;&gt;The overall productivity decreases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is the foundation of any successful relationship, whether professionally or personally. When employees feel they can‚Äôt trust their boss, they feel unsafe and spend more energy on survival than performing at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-innovation-is-reduced&quot;&gt;The innovation is reduced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they distrust their manager, employees can‚Äôt share new idea openly by fear of being shut down. As a consequence, the team/company tends to be stuck in their way of doing things, blocking any form of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employees-are-infantilized-and-less-autonomous&quot;&gt;Employees are infantilized and less autonomous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long proactivity and independence. Micromanaged employees will increasingly lose their autonomy, asking for more and more from the micromanager, caught at his‚Ä¢her own game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employees-are-under-stress-and-have-a-lower-morale&quot;&gt;Employees are under stress and have a lower morale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being micromanaged is highly demotivating for employees, all the more for the best ones. This toxic environment generates stress and a lower self-esteem, damaging the atmosphere of the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employees-have-a-low-scope-of-learning&quot;&gt;Employees have a low scope of learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being constantly told what they should or shouldn‚Äôt do, employees can‚Äôt learn by themselves. As a result, their development is hindered, which is prejudicial for their evolution and the future needs of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-turnover-rises&quot;&gt;The turnover rises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micromanagement tends to kill the feeling of loyalty of the employees. Out of demotivation, the best people will look for what they need elsewhere at some point: a healthy workplace where they can make good use of their talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-go-from-micromanagement-to-trust-and-empowerment&quot;&gt;How to go from micromanagement to trust and empowerment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù to cure yourself of your tendency to micromanage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to trust, while being attuned to your collaborators with &lt;a href=&quot;https://teammood.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regular feedback&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop focusing on the minor errors of your collaborators in order to appreciate the whole picture;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to delegate tasks and empower your team members;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of drowning your team with details, focus on the end result;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Favor initiatives and autonomy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt avoid the confrontation of points of view, but make your collaborators participate in the debate and use open questions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept the lack of control and tolerate failure ‚Äì you can start with letting go of less strategical topics;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inject flexibility in the organization (remote working, flexible working hours, ‚Ä¶) and set a global objective;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept to waste time in the beginning in order to save some later;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think collectively;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in the qualification and experience of the team;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a solid line of communication with the team and foster open and honest discussions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get help from a mentor or a coach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/micromanagement-make-best-people-quit-brigette-hyacinth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brigette Hyacinth&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Future of Leadership: Rise of Automation, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence,&lt;/em&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn this volatile global marketplace, happy and loyal employees are your biggest competitive advantage. If you want performance at scale: Select the right people, provide them with the proper training, tools, and support, and then give them room to get the job done!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former startupper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoiredepins/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; started working in digital 6 years ago. Since the closing of his startup Sharette (in 2016), he‚Äôs offering his services as a freelance consultant, sharing the experience he gained with small and medium-sized companies, and even big corporations: Open Innovation programs, Scrum/Agile coaching, digital marketing strategy (acquisition funnel, SEO, SEA, ‚Ä¶).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;blob:https://app.cloudcannon.com/1b660950-5780-4ac0-999c-1c88978379db&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploring-agile&quot;&gt;Exploring Agile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered Agile methods and more specifically Scrum when I launched my startup in 2012. Like everyone else, I had heard of it. But like everyone else, I didn‚Äôt really get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially trying to define the best governance model in order to optimize the functioning of the team, without wasting people‚Äôs time or the company‚Äôs. The question was: when to gather who and what for?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers of the team told me about it, as Scrum is specifically well fitted for digital teams composed mainly of developers, and including a product owner. It was exactly our case. Plus we needed to constantly develop and test new functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-scrum&quot;&gt;Getting started with Scrum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs be honest, I didn‚Äôt know anything about Scrum. I started reading articles and talking about it with the team and other entrepreneurs who were experiencing similar situations. I learned and trained myself on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started implementing meetings and made them evolve over time. For instance, at the beginning, we had weekly sprints: the sprint planning was taking place on Monday morning and on Friday afternoon we had our sprint demo and retrospective. But I soon realized that one week was too short: too often, developers were saying that they didn‚Äôt have time for the Friday retro as they had to finish working on tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we adopted this format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3-week sprints (in general)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the morning of the 1st day: 4-hour sprint planning meeting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the afternoon of the last day: 45-minute demo followed by a 45-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every morning of the sprint: short &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daily meeting&lt;/a&gt; at a set time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These meetings included the developers (the ‚ÄúTeam‚Äù), the product owner (making the link between the Team and the client), and the Scrum Master (bailer of the methodology, rotating among all the developers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-our-scrum-practice&quot;&gt;Improving our Scrum practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we struggled most with was the sprint planning (and we‚Äôre not the only ones). We had a hard time dividing up the work into well-defined stories that were achievable during the sprint. Little by little, we started calculating/assessing the complexity of each task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity assessment is a very effective Scrum technique in order to better allocate the team‚Äôs time and effort. The idea is to break down each high-level User Story (also called an Epic) into smaller tasks, and to evaluate for each task its level of complexity using the Fibonacci suite: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13‚Ä¶ The gap between two levels of complexity grows bigger as the complexity increases, which forces the team to make a real choice. Any task above 8 should be broken down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 = it‚Äôs very easy, I know how to do it and I‚Äôll do it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 = I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very complex but I have a small doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 = it‚Äôs rather easy but I need to do some researches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product owner constantly receives feedback from the client on the new functionalities. He shares them with the team at the beginning of the new sprint. He also adds new ideas in the backlog every day, and order them by priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got stricter on the last day, even if everything that was planned during the sprint planning isn‚Äôt finished. On the set day, we stop everything and we compute the number of complexity points we managed to overcome, called the ‚ÄúVelocity‚Äù, in order to plan the next sprint. If the sprint was well planned and team members got exactly the right amount of complexity points to work on, this velocity can be used to plan the next sprint. Otherwise, the product owner can increase or decrease it, based on the team‚Äôs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trap of Scrum is the daily meeting: not having a fixed time, taking it for an operational meeting instead of only sharing information, and being too long. Over time, we chose a fixed hour in the morning (between 9 and 11 am depending on the team), and everyone was supposed to share his or her progress and difficulties in no more than 1 minute. Operational work was left for after the daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-limits-of-scrum&quot;&gt;The limits of Scrum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it couldn‚Äôt be all rosy. Scrum is amazing in some contexts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital projects with a level of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With a Team (= developers) of 15 people maximum (if the team is bigger, it should be divided into smaller squads)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The team members should be dedicated to the project (working at least 50% of their time on it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The overall project must be divided into some blocs (the stories) with regular releases and deployments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even in other areas of the company (marketing, HR, ‚Ä¶), as long as the team isn‚Äôt in charge of long actions constrained by external dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but impossible in others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the project cannot be divided into small pieces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the team cannot get regular user feedbacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If developers are spread among several projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the project is constrained by external dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/when-is-scrum-appropriate.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-other-agile-methodologies-extreme-programming-xp&quot;&gt;Testing other Agile methodologies: extreme programming (XP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never used eXtreme Programming in my startup, but I experienced it with one of my clients. The principle of XP is to divide the Team into pairs: one developer does the coding, and the other one reviews the code along the way. And the tandems rotate at the beginning of each sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem a waste of time to have only one developer out of two actually coding ‚Äì many think so. It‚Äôs true. But this methodology has a lot of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It helps produce a code of higher quality and stronger, thus ultimately it saves money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It reduces the need for maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It develops the competencies of the whole team, and developers love it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It fosters collaboration and friendliness among team members as they know each other better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work and implement Scrum in several teams and companies. In the end, the most difficult in Scrum or other Agile methods is not to understand them, but to put them in place and to &lt;strong&gt;keep the rigor over time. But when you do so, it becomes an amazing playground!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Emotional Seismograph, a Fun and Effective Retrospective Format</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/10/30/the-emotional-seismograph-a-fun-and-effective-retrospective-format.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/10/30/the-emotional-seismograph-a-fun-and-effective-retrospective-format.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Retrospectives&lt;/a&gt; are fundamental to Agile teams, and very important to all kinds of organization that wants to adapt over time and continuously improve the way they work.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle is simple: every set of time (a sprint or a period you decide), the team gathers to reflect on what happened in the timeframe and to identify actions for improvement going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives can follow thousands of formats: Positive &amp;amp; True, Learning Matrix, Worked Well Do Differently, AHA‚Ä¶ (you can get inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Retromat&lt;/a&gt;). But one is our favorite and dear to our heart: the &lt;strong&gt;Emotional Seismograph&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use the Emotional Seismograph?&lt;/strong&gt; Not all the time, but using it now and then can bring novelty to your retrospectives. It‚Äôs usually perceived as funner than the other formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use it?&lt;/strong&gt; During your retrospective, each team member shares his or her mood throughout the sprint/timeframe and explains the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe first 3 days I was feeling very enthusiastic about the project. Then my kids at home got sick and I didn‚Äôt sleep much until the middle of the second week. It got a bit better, and then I chose a task that I struggled with way more than I expected. It got me very frustrated for a couple of days, until Mickael helped me get through it. And the last few days, I was a bit stressed to get everything done until the end of the sprint.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some moods can be the result of personal events, which means that the team cannot do anything about them ‚Äì but it is still valuable to know. Others depend on the team and project itself, and can be food for thoughts to improve the internal functioning for the next spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting your Emotional Seismograph to the next level:&lt;/strong&gt; By using a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/en/agile-retrospective/&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt;, you can track your mood along the sprint and avoid forgetting personal and professional events.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 (Easy) Ways To Improve The Mood In The Workplace</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/09/26/10-easy-ways-to-improve-the-mood-in-the-workplace.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/09/26/10-easy-ways-to-improve-the-mood-in-the-workplace.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVQYV2NYtWrVfwAG/gL+NbCogwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cms-image-placeholder&quot; /&gt;Your team‚Äôs mood depends on hundreds of criteria ‚Äì many of whom you can‚Äôt control. But some simple gimmicks can lighten the mood and generate a better spirit in the long term, with little investment from your part.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some &lt;strong&gt;simple and concrete ways to improve your team‚Äôs mood&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduce-plants-in-the-office&quot;&gt;#1 Introduce plants in the office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing plants in your office can be beneficial on all levels. First, studies show that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellisonchair.tamu.edu/health-and-well-being-benefits-of-plants/#.VgrduivNMUk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plants can help people better focus and concentrate on their work&lt;/a&gt;, leading to higher overall productivity. Moreover, by producing oxygen all day long, they help freshen the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/office-1696739-640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants also serve as a reminder of the natural world outside, and create a calmer, more welcoming environment. They‚Äôre certainly easier on the eyes than a sterile white wall or boring office furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offer-healthy-snacks&quot;&gt;#2 Offer healthy snacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many offices offer coffee or sweet snacks to their employees. Why not differentiate yourself by offering some healthy snacks as well? Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are great examples and boost your employees‚Äô energy throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/apples-bananas-basket-235294.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking care of your employees and health, you show them that you care about them. You‚Äôll improve both their mood and productivity, and foster loyalty at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up-some-fun-goals-or-challenges-for-your-team&quot;&gt;#3 Set up some fun goals or challenges for your team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themuse.com/career/what-i-learned-about-management-from-a-road-trip/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Setting team goals&lt;/a&gt; is the backbone of every management strategy, but projects goals and yearly performance metrics can be hard to relate to on a daily basis. Involve your team to define immediate goals and challenges, and not only work-related. They can be goofy things like reaching a team bagel consumption goal or competing to find the weirdest daily news story. This will set up a work environment where fun is appreciated as much as hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-retrospectives&quot;&gt;#4 Run retrospectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the time to reflect on your past Sprint / month / the set of time you‚Äôd like is an amazing way to reflect on past events, to praise your employees‚Äô work, and to identify issues you need to resolve. Having this time and space to express themselves will encourage your employees to invest in improving the processes and internal functioning of the team. By running &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retrospectives&lt;/a&gt;, your team will grow stronger and happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bring-pastries-or-croissants-at-weeklymonthly-team-meetings&quot;&gt;#5 Bring pastries or croissants at weekly/monthly team meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings. We all need them but we all fear them. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;daily meetings&lt;/a&gt; should stay short, why not lighting up the mood for longer ones (weekly meetings, monthly retrospectives‚Ä¶) by bringing some nice pastries or croissants? You don‚Äôt have to do it yourself all the time, the bringer can rotate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, with this ritual, you‚Äôll make sure everyone arrives on time if they don‚Äôt want to see their croissant taken from their hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encourage-fitness-or-sports-activities&quot;&gt;#6 Encourage fitness or sports activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport is good for your health, your concentration‚Ä¶ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/pediatrics/adolescent-medicine/benefits-of-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;your spirit&lt;/a&gt;. Encouraging your employees to practice a sport (if they want to) will help them be at ease with themselves. If you have some spare space in your office, you can schedule fitness or yoga classes during the lunch break or install a gym. Another (smaller) alternative is to install a bathroom for runners to take a shower before going back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If indoor is out of the question, you can also participate in a yearly gym membership, or set aside an hour each week from work for your employees to participate in yoga, wall climbing, volleyball, or any sport they may like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, you can promote team sports as team building activities all along the year, or during a company outing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;celebrate-personal-events&quot;&gt;#7 Celebrate personal events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By investing in your employees‚Äô personal lives, you can show them that they matter for the company. Not everyone likes to share openly their personal life and events (birthday, wedding, birth of a child‚Ä¶), but if you pay attention to your teammates, you can find a way to demonstrate your true interest: bringing a birthday cake, have flowers or a gift sent over their home, ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-some-gratitudenbsp&quot;&gt;#8 Show some gratitude¬†&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By managing your team or a project, you can easily forget that they are human beings. Recognizing their effort and good work can have a huge impact on their morale. A simple way to demonstrate gratitude among your teammates is to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://management30.com/product/kudo-cards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kudo cards&lt;/a&gt;: small tokens of appreciation that managers and teammates can give each other. ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou rock‚Äù, ‚ÄúGreat job‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell done‚Äù, the options are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/kudo-cards-300x197.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudo cards are very efficient to increase recognition of valued work, which encourages intrinsic motivation within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offer-time-away-from-the-office-to-do-some-good&quot;&gt;#9 Offer time away from the office to do some good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking part in a charity or a volunteering action encourages both the company and employees to give back to the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investing in causes they care about is especially important for millennial workers&lt;/a&gt; according to a Deloitte study. By dedicating some time during the year to volunteer, you can show your employees that they are aligned with the company‚Äôs values, and give them a feeling of empowerment and influence over world and local issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not ask your team for suggested charities and events, and make it a group decision? Not only will this help with to encourage team spirit but it also shows how the company seeks out ideas for their employees in decision making and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grant-time-off-to-employees-to-pursue-projects-they-are-passionate-about&quot;&gt;#10 Grant time off to employees to pursue projects they are passionate about&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking on some personal projects can provide an energizing break from regular responsibilities, and can be a source of innovation for your company. At Google for instance, employees are given a day every week to pursue a personal project, no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you grant some free time to your employees to work on personal projects, some may lead to new ideas for the company, most of them will probably not. But most of all, you are giving them a breath of fresh air they will be thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your turn now. &lt;strong&gt;Have you implemented any other technique to improve your team‚Äôs mood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Reduce Stress at Work: 12 Strategies to Handle Stressful Careers</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/08/28/how-to-reduce-stress-at-work-12-strategies-to-handle-stressful-careers.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/08/28/how-to-reduce-stress-at-work-12-strategies-to-handle-stressful-careers.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed. Nervous. Exhausted. Agitated. Pained. All at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, if you‚Äôre like, well, pretty much every worker ever, you know what we‚Äôre talking about: stress. No matter your job, work stress is like the zero on a roulette wheel: it‚Äôs coming around eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, as a species we‚Äôve developed a host of strategies ‚Äî large and small ‚Äî for managing stress. We‚Äôre going to share 12 with you. Why 12? Because it‚Äôs the least stressful number, of course!*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note: scientific backing for this may be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biggies-sleep-eat-right-exercise&quot;&gt;1. The Biggies: Sleep, Eat right, Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you‚Äôve heard these all before. Too bad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/sleep.aspx&quot;&gt;Scientific study after scientific study&lt;/a&gt; has validated the effectiveness of all these things for relieving stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping, eating right, and exercising are all great for your physical health, but more importantly, they also do wonders for psychological health. All three help boost endorphins, regulate dopamine, and simply keep you happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt cheat. (Because sometimes the best stress relief is binge-watching Game of Thrones with a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.) But if you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualspeech.com/blog/managing-anxiety-stress-workplace&quot;&gt;manage the stress&lt;/a&gt; you already have while simultaneously helping bullet-proof yourself from stress in the future, you owe it to yourself to start thinking about all these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;establish-boundaries&quot;&gt;2. Establish Boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the source of work stress is the feeling that work can never end. That feeling‚Äôs certainly grown as electronic communication ensures you can always be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it? Sometimes the best stress-prevention technique is to work on saying no. No emails after 9pm. No work on the weekends. No letting managers add more work to your already-too-full plate. You don‚Äôt have to choose all of these, but you should choose the one or two that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-interruptions&quot;&gt;3. Reduce Interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies prove it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html&quot;&gt;interruptions&lt;/a&gt; make us more agitated. That‚Äôs why one good strategy is to keep interruptions to a minimum. Turn off your internet connection for a while. Or at least close your email reader and chat windows. Put a ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign on your door or cubicle. Wear big headphones so that people know not to bother you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll get more done and won‚Äôt feel pulled in a million directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-things-down&quot;&gt;4. Write Things Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much going on in your head? Use an old technology to help: pencil and paper. When you‚Äôre stressed out because you have too much to keep track of, take a sheet of paper and write down everything you have to do. (Or use an app like RTM, or Trello.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having to worry about remembering what you have to do frees up a surprising amount of emotional energy to actually do those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritize-to-immediately-reduce-work-stress&quot;&gt;5. Prioritize to Immediately Reduce Work Stress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it feels like you‚Äôll just never get everything done, sometimes you just need to realize that you don‚Äôt have to. Make a list of all the tasks on your plate, then decide what really has to get done, and what you‚Äôd just like to have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn‚Äôt mean that what you‚Äôd like to get done isn‚Äôt important. But you can worry about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up-your-desk-or-workspace&quot;&gt;6. Clean up Your Desk or Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, studies show that a cluttered desk helps raise work stress levels. Often when everything else feels unruly, taking 30 minutes to organize your workspace can bring a relieving feeling of calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: this same strategy applies to your apartment, your house, your car, your briefcase, or any other place you keep your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-up-early&quot;&gt;7. Show up Early&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stressed because you‚Äôre always running behind schedule, what can do the trick is coming to work 10 minutes early every day. Get some coffee, put your stuff away, and plan out your day. By the time ‚Äúworktime‚Äù hits, you‚Äôre already rolling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listen-to-music&quot;&gt;8. Listen to Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Congreve wrote that ‚ÄúMusick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast.‚Äù He‚Äôs right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/l0MYEpCzZTQqdQSju&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a little de-stressing at work, throw on the headphones and dial up whatever tunes make you happy. Beyonce? Bach? 2-Pac? Doesn‚Äôt really matter ‚Äî if you‚Äôre digging it, you‚Äôre feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;schedule-in-breaks&quot;&gt;9. Schedule in Breaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs tempting to feel like the only way to manage a stressful workload is to power through it, non-stop. Turns out that‚Äôs actually counter-productive. It‚Äôs a fact: breaks let you get more done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre worried about all the work you have to do, set breaks for yourself. Work hard for 25 minutes, then walk around for 10. Work hard for another 25 minutes, then read something stupid online. Give yourself time to recharge; it‚Äôll keep you from burning yourself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it is time to take a vacation, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clicktime.com/time-off-management&quot;&gt;schedule time off&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy some much-needed R&amp;amp;R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eliminate-unnecessary-meetings&quot;&gt;10. Eliminate Unnecessary Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is falls more into ‚Äúlarger strategies‚Äù than ‚Äúthings to do right now.‚Äù That said, at plenty of workplaces, meetings pile on until there‚Äôs no time to simply sit down and work. That‚Äôs stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you are on the totem pole, you‚Äôll be helping everyone else on your team if you advocate for dropping unnecessary meetings. There‚Äôll be fewer things to worry about, and you‚Äôll free up more time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reward-yourself-for-working&quot;&gt;11. Reward Yourself for Working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best cure for stress is to simply be nice to yourself. And what better reason is there to be nice to yourself than for having done some good work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with breaks (see #9 above), small rewards can be a great way to keep yourself productive, while helping you tally the amount of work you‚Äôve actually gotten done. So work hard for a while, then reward yourself by writing to a friend. Or having a small treat. Or leaving the office for 10 minutes. By holding those rewards back until you‚Äôve earned them, you‚Äôll be more motivated to work. But by giving them to yourself, you‚Äôll tell yourself you deserve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-thankful&quot;&gt;12. Be Thankful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silly as it might sound, cultivating a thankful attitude can reduce both general and work stress, and make you happier. As a general life practice, working to be more thankful is one of the best ways to keep you stress-free (or at least stress-reduced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/26gsjCZpPolPr3sBy&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to do this. Keep a gratitude journal. Force yourself to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to three people a day. Spend 5 minutes every night going over what you‚Äôre thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever of these you choose, keep doing it. In a short period of time, you‚Äôll notice how much better you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evaluating Your Team‚Äôs Health With the Niko-Niko Calendar</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/24/evaluating-your-teams-health-with-the-niko-niko-calendar.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Would you go out of your house with a rain coat if it wasn‚Äôt for the weather forecast to warn you of the rain coming up? How about the stock market: would you invest in shares without checking their values and trend? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In team management, you can have all sorts of KPIs to measure and display how well your team is doing: productivity, lead time, bugs, ‚Ä¶ Tracking those metrics helps the team to identify problems early and improve. The only one that is missing is the actual mood and motivation of your team members. And I don‚Äôt need to tell you &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;how important it is for the good of the project&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs the reason why, a few years ago (in 2006 more precisely), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html&quot;&gt;Akinori SAKATA&lt;/a&gt; invented the &lt;strong&gt;Niko Niko calendar&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a. the smiley calendar or the happiness index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/happy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Happy worker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;What is the Niko-niko calendar?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko calendar is the application of a very important principle in Agile project management defined by american engineer and Agile expert Tom Gilb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect nor precise. The objective is to quantify something that wasn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/nikoniko-calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Niko-Niko calendar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does the Niko-niko calendar work? It‚Äôs a simple calendar with everybody‚Äôs name on it. At the end of the day, each team member is invited to share their mood of the day, sticking smilies happy üòÑ, straight üò¨ or frowning üôÅ or color stickers on it. That‚Äôs actually where its name comes from: Niko means smile in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko doesn‚Äôt provide an exact measure of the team‚Äôs mood, but it helps quantifying the well-being, morale and motivation ‚Äì three factors that are usually difficult to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team‚Äôs spirit is even more important for an Agile team as the success of the project relies on it. It‚Äôs the reason why the Niko-niko calendar was first invented for Agile teams. It provides a general view of how well the team is doing, and not just at individual level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-the-niko-niko-method&quot;&gt;How to use the Niko-niko method?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niko-niko must follow some principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone‚Äôs mood should be visible to the others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should never be hold against someone or be considered as an individual objective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moods should be observed during the next day‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;daily meeting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The manager / team leader / scrum master should try to understand and treat ‚Äúabnormality‚Äù, good or bad: a common bad day shared by the whole team, a person that is constantly happy while the rest of the team is unhappy and vice-versa, a general deterioration of the team‚Äôs mood, a shared ‚Äúhappy‚Äù mood even if the project isn‚Äôt good wel‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/sad.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sad worker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In concrete terms, to use the Niko-niko method, you can build &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/niko-niko/diy/2013/05/07/build-your-own-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;your own Niko-niko calendar&lt;/a&gt; with a daily calendar and a stack of color stickers. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/en/Niko-Niko/&quot;&gt;choose to use an online tool&lt;/a&gt; if your team is working remotely, or simply if you want to be able to analyze trends. An online tool can also help you gather comments more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-leverage-the-niko-niko-calendar&quot;&gt;How to leverage the Niko-niko calendar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt let your Niko-niko hang there for nothing! Quantifying your team‚Äôs mood is only the first step, you need to be able to act on it, where your team is in a good or bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html&quot;&gt;Reacting to one of several teammates‚Äô bad mood&lt;/a&gt; can seem pretty obvious: you don‚Äôt want a bad situation to degenerate, and you need your team to be at its best in order to deliver results. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html&quot;&gt;understanding and leveraging your team‚Äôs good mood&lt;/a&gt; is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from a Niko-niko calendar is a huge opportunity for reflection. You can get instant feedback from changes that are altering the work environment. It can also be included in a reporting for top management (leaving it anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Are you convinced? Start implementing a Niko-niko calendar in your team, either by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/niko-niko/diy/2013/05/07/build-your-own-niko-niko-calendar.html&quot;&gt;building it yourself&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/en/Niko-Niko/&quot;&gt;using an online one such as TeamMood&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you think.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>How to Cultivate a Workplace Culture of Gratitude</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-core-beliefs-and-culture.pdf&quot;&gt;88% of employees and 94% of executives&lt;/a&gt; say that they believe company culture is crucial to success. If you want to create a powerful environment for your business, then you need to be willing to prize and prioritize the right ideas for your employees. For instance, one value worth cultivating is ‚Äúgratitude‚Äù. Employees who are thankful for where they are and what they accomplish will constantly go above and beyond to serve their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, how do you bring a culture of gratitude into your workplace? The following steps could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-by-setting-an-example&quot;&gt;1. Start by Setting an Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you want to implement a change in your company culture, the first thing you need to do is think about how you can set the right example. Remember, as the owner or manager of your business, you‚Äôre not just someone who cuts pay-checks and tells people what to do every day. You‚Äôre the leader that your employees turn to when they‚Äôre looking for advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/thanks.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Showing gratitude&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people see you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlsun/2017/12/18/how-to-create-a-culture-of-gratitude-in-the-workplace/&quot;&gt;practicing gratitude every day&lt;/a&gt;, they‚Äôll start to embrace the concept as a natural part of your workplace culture. So, how do you bring gratitude into your life? That‚Äôs simple. All you need to do is start showing your appreciation for things - both little and big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone accomplishes a task in your organization, show them how much you appreciate it by giving them a pat on the back. When you meet your goals or targets, share that with your team and show them how every success adds up in the long term. And more importantly, demonstrate¬†&lt;strong&gt;the right values and behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;, because that‚Äôs what matters the most in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recognize-your-employees-in-the-way-they-prefer&quot;&gt;2. Recognize Your Employees in the Way They Prefer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is one of the most powerful things changing modern workforces. In fact, according to some studies, approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.workstars.com/recognition-and-engagement-blog/2017/08/18/10-knockout-employee-recognition-statistics-for-hr-infographic/&quot;&gt;69% of employees&lt;/a&gt; say that they would work harder and take on more responsibilities if they felt their efforts were appreciated. If you want to make sure that you‚Äôre building a culture of gratitude for your organization, start by thanking your employees for their hard work in a manner they can really resonate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some small achievements, a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù can be enough to make your staff feel better about their career. For bigger accomplishments, you might look for more significant ways to show your recognition. For instance, you could throw an office party celebrating a huge client win or share a company newsletter that highlights your top performers. Some organization still think that the ‚Äúemployee of the month‚Äù strategy works well as a way of keeping their hires happy too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-your-people-reasons-to-be-thankful&quot;&gt;3. Give Your People Reasons to be Thankful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where countless companies are beginning to explore ideas like remote working to help their employees tackle stress and workplace gyms for wellbeing, it pays to go above and beyond for your staff. If you want your employees to feel excited by the fact that they‚Äôre part of your team, and you‚Äôre hoping that your reputation as an excellent employer will spread to lure new talent to your company, then look for creative ways to make your staff smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little extras and benefits you put into place to delight your team will depend on what they appreciate most. For instance, academic minds might like it if you sign them up for trips to regular conferences and training sessions. Plenty of employees like having an opportunity to expand and improve their skills. Providing this education not only makes your hires happy, but also gives you access to new talents too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, giving your employees a reason to be thankful could be as simple as signing them up for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javapresse.com/pages/subscriptions-gifts&quot;&gt;monthly coffee subscription&lt;/a&gt;, so that they can enjoy fresh java every day. This not only stops people from complaining about the stale drinks you previously had in your office kitchen, it also gives your team the antioxidants and great flavor they need to boost their mood and their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;look-for-ways-to-give-back&quot;&gt;4. Look for Ways to Give Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing a true culture of gratitude means more than giving something back to your employees. It could also mean that you look for ways to support your community and local causes that need your help. Signing up for a partnership with a charity that your team cares about and giving them paid leave to go and offer their services to that organization is a great way to share the idea of gratitude far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with charities gives your employees an opportunity to express their gratitude for the privileges they enjoy as part of your company, and essentially share the wealth. As well as allowing staff to take part in formal programs, you could also ask employees to come up with and suggest their own initiatives. You‚Äôd be surprised how much a caring nature matters to today‚Äôs hires. Modern employees - particularly those in the millennial demographic, like to feel as though they‚Äôre having an impact on the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing your team that you‚Äôre willing to give something back both improves your culture of gratitude and may help you to attract new candidates to your company too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-time-to-reflect&quot;&gt;5. Take Time to Reflect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, sometimes the best way to nurture a culture of gratitude in your company is to simply slow down. When you stop rushing around after deadlines and take the time to stop and smell the coffee every now and again, it‚Äôs easier to reflect on where you are, and where you came from. Although running a business can be hard work, when you begin to reflect, you‚Äôll realize just how lucky you‚Äôve been so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the toughest of times, most of us have something to be grateful for. Whether it‚Äôs a family back home that supports you or a great USP in your business, make sure that you appreciate what you have. Try to encourage moments of reflection for your team, so that they never lose sight of the positive things in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-a-purpose&quot;&gt;6. Give a Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team should have clear, achievable milestones with a good plan, eg prioritized things to do. When the deliverables are shipped, make sure that the team gets the feedback about them, about how they really impacted the customers, so that the individuals feel they made a difference in something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

He enjoys sharing his advice on how to build a successful company and often uses his experiences to help him write insightful articles for blogs across the internet. Company culture has quickly become one of the most important components of a successful business. After all, your people can either make or break your company. If they‚Äôre happy and satisfied with their jobs, then they‚Äôre sure to be more productive and focused in their roles. On the other hand, if they‚Äôre constantly looking forward to the moment that they can clock out and go home, then your organization will struggle to thrive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Leverage Your Team‚Äôs Good Mood</title>
        <link>https://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is happiness in the air? Are your teammates smiling and joking around? Is your team productivity skyrocketing? Congratulations, your team is in a good mood! And the results are there: your team delivers in no time, the job is well-done, they are more creative and thorough‚Ä¶ The dream comes true :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what‚Äôs next? If you rest on your laurels and hope for the situation to go on forever, you will most certainly be disappointed. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html&quot;&gt;when your team is experiencing a bad mood&lt;/a&gt;, you must understand the causes for this happy mood in order to keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-the-situation-permanent-or-temporary&quot;&gt;Is the situation permanent or temporary?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you recently noticed a sudden change of mood or is the situation more or less stable? And if it‚Äôs stable, has is always been like that or has the situation evolve over the months/years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a century ago, American researcher and professor of educational psychology Bruce Wayne Tuckman developed a theory of group dynamics, published in his article &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1965-12187-001&quot;&gt;Developmental sequence in small groups&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Tuckman‚Äôs theory of group development, every group grows through 4 phases: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and Adjourning. These phases are necessary and inevitable in order for the team to grow, face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results. They are usually followed by a fifth phase named ‚ÄúAdjourning‚Äù, that involves completing the task and breaking up the team, paving the way for a new exciting project to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/tuckman_s_stages_of_development.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tuckman&#39;s Stages of Development&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: http://margarethillary.com/team-work/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering your happy team, are they currently in a Forming stage? Norming? Performing? Understanding the group dynamic can help you better anticipate the changes and help your teammates be at their utmost performance. Indeed, in each stage, you can use different strategies in order to facilitate the development of high performing teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forming: picking the team, discuss the goals, make sure the team develops a shared mental model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forming: act as a resource person to the team, develop mutual trust and calm the work environment by resolving conflicts and tensions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Norming &amp;amp; Performing: get feedback from your teammates, allow for the transfer of leadership, set aside time for planning and engaging the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outperforming &amp;amp; Adjourning: expand initiatives and integrate new members, allow for flexibility in team roles, create future leadership opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-root-or-simple-causes&quot;&gt;What are the (root or simple) causes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If root causes can be explained by Tuckman‚Äôs stages, a good mood can simply be the consequence of a team building activity that was particularly appreciated, a habit to bring in croissants at the end of each sprint, a new wellness program‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;boost wellbeing and happiness at work&lt;/a&gt; with theses simple acts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a culture of trust and transparency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/07/04/how-to-cultivate-a-workplace-culture-of-gratitude.html&quot;&gt;Show gratitude and value positive intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foster empowerment and accountability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Favor breaks and downtime&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch a project that people care about / are proud of&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Favor friendship and informal times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more than anything else, don‚Äôt forget to take the time to celebrate successes or good news with your team. These moments of commemoration and gratitude are essential to keep your team‚Äôs motivation up and pave the way to new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you cannot manage everything, some external sources can cause a happy or bad mood, beyond your control. The best thing you can do? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/&quot;&gt;Ask your team members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Either you are sensing there is an issue in your team or you are using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; that tells you so, you can‚Äôt afford to ignore it. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html&quot;&gt;a bad mood will affect your team productivity&lt;/a&gt;: unhappy people are proven to be &lt;strong&gt;10% less productive&lt;/strong&gt; than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if a bad situation arises, here is what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-to-the-roots-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;1 - Get to the roots of the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel some tension among team members, unspoken issues or a general growing discontent, you need to understand where it‚Äôs coming from. Small quarrels or disagreements are usually fueled by a deeper issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/why.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Chicken and pigs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a stressful deadline coming up? Were there a change in the strategic orientation of the product? Is the company to be going through a bad patch? A specific individual driving everyone‚Äôs morale down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html&quot;&gt;paying attention to the signs&lt;/a&gt;, big or small, or use a tool to anonymously question your team members such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teammood.com/&quot;&gt;TeamMood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discuss-the-situation&quot;&gt;2 - Discuss the situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know (or think to know) the situation and its causes, you must discuss it with your team members, individually or as a team according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bad mood is a general state shared by the whole or part of your team, you can address the issue quickly during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;Daily standup meeting&lt;/a&gt; or come back to it during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teammood.com/2018/02/07/a-simple-guide-to-run-agile-retrospectives.html&quot;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/a&gt; (but beware not to let the situation settle in and worsen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it‚Äôs more an individual state, let everyone know that you are open and willing to discuss whatever problem they may have. And encourage your team to share their issue in an anonymous comment if they don‚Äôt want to discuss it openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-a-solution-together&quot;&gt;3 - Find a solution together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, ‚ÄúTwo heads are better than one.‚Äù If you try to find a solution on your own, it‚Äôs likely that it will fail: your team members may not subscribe to it, or you‚Äôll just miss the point and the responsibility will fall on your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have different options here: you can choose to discuss the solution in a team meeting, to set up an anonymous idea box or an open board, to have one-on-one formal discussions or a group informal chat during a team afterwork‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arouse-friendliness&quot;&gt;4 - Arouse friendliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snacknation.com/blog/employee-happiness/&quot;&gt;close work friendships&lt;/a&gt; boost employee satisfaction by 50%&lt;/strong&gt; and that people with a &lt;strong&gt;best friend at work are 7 times more likely to engage fully in their work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/friends-tv-show.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chicken and pigs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, if you want your team to work hard and get results, you need to create the perfect environment. Of course, you can‚Äôt force your team members to become friends. But you can create the conditions for people to bond: team afterwork at the end of the sprint, lunch break together once in a while, team building activities‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lead-by-example&quot;&gt;5 - Lead by example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you be in the middle of the storm or simply handle a temporary decrease in employee moral, don‚Äôt forget that your attitude as a manager will greatly impact your team members. Set the example by having a positive and open speech, sharing information transparently, being attentive and openly share your own problems. Don‚Äôt forget also to show gratitude to your employees and to praise their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply by acknowledging their issues and recognizing their effort and/or results, you can turn the situation around and motivate your team members again.&lt;/p&gt;
