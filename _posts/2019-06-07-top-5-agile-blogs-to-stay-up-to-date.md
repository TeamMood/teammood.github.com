Knowledge cannot be fixed, it must evolve over time. I have been working in Agile – and coaching Agile teams – for years now, but I still feel the need to update my knowledge.

Here is a selection of blogs that **inspire me and help me &nbsp;****stay up to date on Agile best practices and trends**.

## [**Luis Goncalves’s Blog**](https://luis-goncalves.com/blog)

Luis is a Management Coach and Agile Coach, and the co-author of the book *Getting Value Out Of Agile Retrospectives*. In his blog, he writes about ScrumMaster development, coaching, and organizational transformation. What I like the most about Luis Gon&ccedil;alves’s blog is the fact that he shares practical ideas that can be implemented quickly.

If you only read one article from this blog, I would pick: [Scrum Values Are The Foundation Of Agile. Here’s Why… ](https://luis-goncalves.com/scrum-values/)

## [**Agile42’s blog**](https://www.agile42.com/en/blog)

Agile42 is a coaching, training, and consulting agency in the areas of agility and leadership. In their blog, they share short and synthetic articles on all kinds of topics about Agile: events, metrics, lean, XP, …

My favorite article? [Agile in the Bathtub](https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2012/08/17/agile-bathtub/).

## [**Romain Pichler’s blog**](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/)

Roman Pichler is a product management expert specialized in digital products. An entire section of his blog is dedicated to Lean, Agile, and Scrum processes.

What differentiates his blog from others are the ready-to-use templates and resources he shares on a regular basis: a [template for formulating great sprint goals](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/sprint-goal-template/), a checklist for preparing a sprint planning, … They are priceless.

## [**The Nobl Academy**](https://academy.nobl.io/)

Behind the Nobl Academy is a consulting firm helping leaders design cultures that deliver on strategy and adapt to change. This blog focuses more on company culture and leadership – but these themes are crucial for Agile teams too\! Their tools, tips, and use cases are invaluable.

If you don’t know where to start, you can read this article: [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Psychological Safety](https://academy.nobl.io/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-psychological-safety/).


## [**Leading Answers**](https://leadinganswers.typepad.com/) **by Mike Griffiths**

Mike Griffiths is an independent author, project manager, Agile trainer and consultant. In his blog, Mike shares ideas on leadership and agile project management. His articles are pretty advanced and thorough.

One of my favorite articles from Mike lists the most important leadership practices to manage a team: [Top 10 Team Practices](https://leadinganswers.typepad.com/leading_answers/2008/03/top-10-team-pra.html).
