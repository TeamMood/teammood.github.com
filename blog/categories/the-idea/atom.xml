    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you search the Web for resources about entrepreneurship, (lean)startup and so on, you'll find a lot of articles and advices, but it is very hard to know how to begin, and what's could be your next move.</p>

<p>I don't remember how I get on this when I was doing some research for my <a href="http://teammood.com">TeamMood project</a>, but I found an awesome gold nugget : <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a></p>

<p><a href="http://startitup.co"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/startitup.png" title="" ></a></p>

<p>Based on the Lean Startup, it helps me lot with valuable advices, and a lot of articles containing several samples.</p>

<p>It is very simple to use : you go through the step by step guide, answer some questions about your idea/team/competition etcâ€¦ and it progressively builds your Lean Canvas and helps you to structure your mind.</p>

<p>Also note that these guys are expecting a lot of feedback, and they are super reactive.</p>

<p>So if you have an idea, and you don't know where to start, go on <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a> !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since I wanted to build a project of my own. On a daily basis, I give advices to IT companies about technologies, methodologies and strategies to build awesome products. And now it is my turn !</p>

<p>So I finally took the time to build my first side project: <a href="http://teammood.com" class="teammood">TeamMood</a> !</p>

<p><a href="http://teammood.com"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/coming-soon.png" title="" ></a></p>

<p>I will not explain what the project is about in this post, I prefer to let you discover the idea through the very first MVP which is a simple "<a href="http://teammood.com">coming soon</a>" page and let you give me a lot of <a href="mailto:hello@teammood.com">feedback</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the idea scratched me since many months because I feel that it can bring a lot in some companies that I work with. But it took me a lot of time before starting to build something, probably because I thought that if I begin to do this, I'd have to pull it to the end, ie some kind of commitment.</p>

<p>And yes, I use LeanStartup to explore the idea, because I don't know if it will be a good one and if people will be interested. So let's learn with this first MVP and we'll see :-)</p>
