    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Niko-niko calendar is an Agile practice which aims to detect patterns of change of mood of a team over time.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/niko-niko.jpg" title="An example of Niko-niko calendar" ></p>

<p>The technic is very easy: at the end of the day, each team member paste a sticker on a calendar to tell if he had a good day at work.</p>

<p>In other word, you probably ever went back to home from work and feel that you had a bad day, or you did not feel "productive". That's a red sticker.</p>

<p>After some time, you'll see some color being dominant, it will give an insight of the mood of the team.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to take a look at the Niko-niko calendar during the Agile retrospective.</p>

<p>It is not exact science, it is just a simple tool to get some more informations about the team.</p>

<p>The Niko-niko calendar is also know as "happiness index". Also note that "niko" means "smile" in the japanese language.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Niko-niko calendar is from an <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html" target="_blank">article from Akinori SAKATA in 2006</a>.</p>
