At last, I finally "officially" launched the TeamMood project by using two announce ments through Twitter, this is the one in English (another one was made in French):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr"><p>Guys, I'm launching my first side-project !! <a href="http://t.co/9h4lyIIMtc" title="http://teammood.com">teammood.com</a>, feel free to share the love ;-) <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23teammood">#teammood</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23nikoniko">#nikoniko</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23happy">#happy</a></p>&mdash; Nicolas Deverge (@ndeverge) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndeverge/status/324860646296539136">18 avril 2013</a></blockquote>

<!--More-->

So far so good, in just hour, I had 29 people who registred by giving their email for about 179 unique visitors.

And I also received many positive feedbacks from some people.

I think that my first MVP has quite a good result, so now, I have to keep on the adventure !!
