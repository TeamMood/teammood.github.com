If youâ€™re reading this blog, you are probably aware of the **benefits of fostering [well-being in the workplace](https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html)**, in terms of employee engagement and productivity.

*(Note that we talk about well-being rather than happiness, which would be rather presumptuous as happiness depends on a number of factors that companies and managers cannot control).*

But do you know how to make it happen?

Weâ€™ve gathered **our best resources** to guide you through this change. Follow the lead\!&nbsp;

## **Adapting your hiring process**

It all starts with hiring the right person for the right job. And Iâ€™m not talking about competencies only. [Culture fit](https://blog.teammood.com/2019/02/19/hire-for-culture-fit-not-competencies.html) is one of the key criteria â€“ if not the most important â€“ to infuse a feeling of belonging to your team members.

Moreover, youâ€™ll need to pay attention to the expectations of your candidates. Motivation drivers have evolved over the years, and [hiring millennials](https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/02/managers-do-you-know-how-to-work-with-millennials.html) can be challenging for managers who donâ€™t understand them.

And once youâ€™ve found the perfect candidate, why not trying the transparency card and [sharing the actual mood of your team](https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/convincing-candidates-to-join-your-team.html)?

## Managing for the well-being of your teammates

Well-being at work depends on a number of factors you (as a manager) should always keep in mind:

* Making [employee recognition](https://blog.teammood.com/recognition/workplace/tips/2013/10/21/the-importance-of-employee-recognition-in-the-workplace.html) a pillar of your management style
* Focusing on [employee engagement](https://blog.teammood.com/engagement/tips/2013/07/30/how-to-improve-the-employee-engagement-with-these-5-great-tips.html)
* Opting for a [benevolent leadership style](https://blog.teammood.com/2019/03/05/dare-benevolent-leadership.html) rather than [micromanaging](https://blog.teammood.com/2018/11/29/dont-fall-in-the-trap-of-micromanagement.html) your team members
* Encouraging [work-life balance](https://blog.teammood.com/2019/04/16/how-to-encourage-work-life-balance-at-work.html)
* and all the perks you can implement to [improve the mood in the workplace](https://blog.teammood.com/2018/09/26/10-easy-ways-to-improve-the-mood-in-the-workplace.html) (we listed 10 of the best ideas we found).

## **Dealing with conflicts**

Even the perfect company cannot avoid dissatisfaction and conflicts. However, managers can make a difference by identifying the [signs of underlying conflict](https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/04/11/8-warnings-that-a-crisis-is-looming-among-your-teammates.html) early on, and not letting the situation escalate.
