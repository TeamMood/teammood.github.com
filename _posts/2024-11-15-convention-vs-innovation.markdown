As leaders, we often face a critical choice: should we follow established best practices or take a contrarian approach?

Making this decision can feel like navigating through a thick fog of uncertainty.

## The conformity conundrum

When should you follow the crowd, and when should you break away? Here's how to decide.

### When to follow the conventional path

**Non-competitive situations**

Basic processes and safety protocols exist for a reason. When lives or fundamental operations are at stake, following established guidelines helps maintain consistency and prevent costly mistakes.

**Proven but underutilized practices**

If your environment hasn't yet adopted well-tested best practices, implementing them can give you significant advantages. There's no need to reinvent the wheel when existing solutions work well.

**Building foundational skills**

When you're just starting out, following established paths helps you understand the basics. You need to know the rules before you can break them effectively.

### When to take the contrarian path

**Zero-sum competitions**

Doing what everyone else does leads to mediocrity. If all players follow the same strategy, no one wins big. Standing out becomes crucial for success.

**Overcrowded playbooks**

When everyone follows the same tactics, those tactics lose their edge. If your entire industry uses identical approaches, the potential for differentiation through contrarian thinking increases.

**Stagnation through conformity**

If standard approaches aren't yielding results anymore, it's time for change. Breaking from conventional wisdom can help overcome plateaus and find new growth opportunities.

## Feedback to guide your through the path chosen

Being a contrarian is risky.

So how can you minimize that risk?

By listening to your team's voice.

Your team's feedback tells a clear story:

- High morale with current practices → Stay the course
- Declining engagement → Time to innovate
- Mixed signals → Dig deeper with segmentation

And during times of high morale, you can proactively innovate to stay ahead. Your team's mood will guide you through the changes.
