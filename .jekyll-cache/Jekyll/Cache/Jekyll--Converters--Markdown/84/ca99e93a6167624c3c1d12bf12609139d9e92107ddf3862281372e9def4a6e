I"ê<p>Overwhelmed. Nervous. Exhausted. Agitated. Pained. All at once.</p>

<p>Yep, if you‚Äôre like, well, pretty much every worker ever, you know what we‚Äôre talking about: stress. No matter your job, work stress is like the zero on a roulette wheel: it‚Äôs coming around eventually.</p>

<p>Luckily, as a species we‚Äôve developed a host of strategies ‚Äî large and small ‚Äî for managing stress. We‚Äôre going to share 12 with you. Why 12? Because it‚Äôs the least stressful number, of course!*</p>

<p>*Note: scientific backing for this may be minimal.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-biggies-sleep-eat-right-exercise">1. The Biggies: Sleep, Eat right, Exercise</h2>

<p>Yes, you‚Äôve heard these all before. Too bad. <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/sleep.aspx">Scientific study after scientific study</a> has validated the effectiveness of all these things for relieving stress.</p>

<p>Sleeping, eating right, and exercising are all great for your physical health, but more importantly, they also do wonders for psychological health. All three help boost endorphins, regulate dopamine, and simply keep you happier.</p>

<p>Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt cheat. (Because sometimes the best stress relief is binge-watching Game of Thrones with a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.) But if you want to <a href="https://virtualspeech.com/blog/managing-anxiety-stress-workplace">manage the stress</a> you already have while simultaneously helping bullet-proof yourself from stress in the future, you owe it to yourself to start thinking about all these things.</p>

<h2 id="2-establish-boundaries">2. Establish Boundaries</h2>

<p>Often the source of work stress is the feeling that work can never end. That feeling‚Äôs certainly grown as electronic communication ensures you can always be found.</p>

<p>Or does it? Sometimes the best stress-prevention technique is to work on saying no. No emails after 9pm. No work on the weekends. No letting managers add more work to your already-too-full plate. You don‚Äôt have to choose all of these, but you should choose the one or two that matter to you.</p>

<h2 id="3-reduce-interruptions">3. Reduce Interruptions</h2>

<p>Studies prove it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html">interruptions</a> make us more agitated. That‚Äôs why one good strategy is to keep interruptions to a minimum. Turn off your internet connection for a while. Or at least close your email reader and chat windows. Put a ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign on your door or cubicle. Wear big headphones so that people know not to bother you.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll get more done and won‚Äôt feel pulled in a million directions.</p>

<h2 id="4-write-things-down">4. Write Things Down</h2>

<p>Too much going on in your head? Use an old technology to help: pencil and paper. When you‚Äôre stressed out because you have too much to keep track of, take a sheet of paper and write down everything you have to do. (Or use an app like RTM, or Trello.)</p>

<p>Not having to worry about remembering what you have to do frees up a surprising amount of emotional energy to actually do those things.</p>

<h2 id="5-prioritize-to-immediately-reduce-work-stress">5. Prioritize to Immediately Reduce Work Stress</h2>

<p>If it feels like you‚Äôll just never get everything done, sometimes you just need to realize that you don‚Äôt have to. Make a list of all the tasks on your plate, then decide what really has to get done, and what you‚Äôd just like to have done.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that what you‚Äôd like to get done isn‚Äôt important. But you can worry about that later.</p>

<h2 id="6-clean-up-your-desk-or-workspace">6. Clean up Your Desk or Workspace</h2>

<p>Again, studies show that a cluttered desk helps raise work stress levels. Often when everything else feels unruly, taking 30 minutes to organize your workspace can bring a relieving feeling of calm.</p>

<p>Note: this same strategy applies to your apartment, your house, your car, your briefcase, or any other place you keep your stuff.</p>

<h2 id="7-show-up-early">7. Show up Early</h2>

<p>If you get stressed because you‚Äôre always running behind schedule, what can do the trick is coming to work 10 minutes early every day. Get some coffee, put your stuff away, and plan out your day. By the time ‚Äúworktime‚Äù hits, you‚Äôre already rolling!</p>

<h2 id="8-listen-to-music">8. Listen to Music</h2>

<p>William Congreve wrote that ‚ÄúMusick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast.‚Äù He‚Äôs right.</p>

<center><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0MYEpCzZTQqdQSju" width="480" height="330" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>If you need a little de-stressing at work, throw on the headphones and dial up whatever tunes make you happy. Beyonce? Bach? 2-Pac? Doesn‚Äôt really matter ‚Äî if you‚Äôre digging it, you‚Äôre feeling better.</p>

<h2 id="9-schedule-in-breaks">9. Schedule in Breaks</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs tempting to feel like the only way to manage a stressful workload is to power through it, non-stop. Turns out that‚Äôs actually counter-productive. It‚Äôs a fact: breaks let you get more done.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre worried about all the work you have to do, set breaks for yourself. Work hard for 25 minutes, then walk around for 10. Work hard for another 25 minutes, then read something stupid online. Give yourself time to recharge; it‚Äôll keep you from burning yourself out.</p>

<p>And when it is time to take a vacation, be sure to <a href="https://www.clicktime.com/time-off-management">schedule time off</a> and enjoy some much-needed R&amp;R.</p>

<h2 id="10-eliminate-unnecessary-meetings">10. Eliminate Unnecessary Meetings</h2>

<p>This is falls more into ‚Äúlarger strategies‚Äù than ‚Äúthings to do right now.‚Äù That said, at plenty of workplaces, meetings pile on until there‚Äôs no time to simply sit down and work. That‚Äôs stressful.</p>

<p>No matter where you are on the totem pole, you‚Äôll be helping everyone else on your team if you advocate for dropping unnecessary meetings. There‚Äôll be fewer things to worry about, and you‚Äôll free up more time for everybody.</p>

<h2 id="11-reward-yourself-for-working">11. Reward Yourself for Working</h2>

<p>Sometimes the best cure for stress is to simply be nice to yourself. And what better reason is there to be nice to yourself than for having done some good work?</p>

<p>Along with breaks (see #9 above), small rewards can be a great way to keep yourself productive, while helping you tally the amount of work you‚Äôve actually gotten done. So work hard for a while, then reward yourself by writing to a friend. Or having a small treat. Or leaving the office for 10 minutes. By holding those rewards back until you‚Äôve earned them, you‚Äôll be more motivated to work. But by giving them to yourself, you‚Äôll tell yourself you deserve them.</p>

<h2 id="12-be-thankful">12. Be Thankful</h2>

<p>Silly as it might sound, cultivating a thankful attitude can reduce both general and work stress, and make you happier. As a general life practice, working to be more thankful is one of the best ways to keep you stress-free (or at least stress-reduced).</p>

<center><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26gsjCZpPolPr3sBy" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>There are lots of ways to do this. Keep a gratitude journal. Force yourself to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to three people a day. Spend 5 minutes every night going over what you‚Äôre thankful for.</p>

<p>Whichever of these you choose, keep doing it. In a short period of time, you‚Äôll notice how much better you feel.</p>
