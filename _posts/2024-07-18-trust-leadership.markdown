Look at that Gallup data about employee trust in organizational leadership.

![Listening & amplifying](https://res.cloudinary.com/teammood/image/upload/v1721130551/newsletter/2024-07/SCR-20240702-pbaw.png){: width="1820" height="880"}

Trust dipped slightly at the onset of COVID but declined further as employees faced the prospect of returning to the office.

Trust is influenced by many subtle factors.

While we're all familiar with how micromanagement, poor communication, or lack of transparency can weaken trust, what about the less obvious elements?

Let's explore a few small, often overlooked factors that, when combined, can inadvertently lead to distrust.

### **1. Unintentional cultural insensitivity**

Sensitivity has never been higher and the smallest slip-ups can have dramatic effects.

You may unknowingly use language or make decisions that offend team members from different cultural backgrounds.

**Solution:** Invest in cultural competence training and actively seek feedback from team members about cultural issues.

### 2. Misalignment with organizational values

With so many layers of leadership and management, sometimes it’s a maze to understand exactly what organizational values are.

A misalignment can create cognitive dissonance and erode trust.

**Solution:** Regularly review and discuss organizational values with the team, and explicitly tie decisions to these values.

### 3. Inadequate handling of remote/hybrid work challenges

Like the chart at the beginning shows, challenges adapting to new working conditions can create trust issues.

Failing to address the unique needs of remote or hybrid team members can lead to feelings of isolation or unfair treatment.

**Solution:** Implement clear communication protocols for remote work and ensure equal opportunities for all team members, regardless of location.

### 4. Failure to advocate for the team to higher management

When team members feel their leader doesn't represent their interests to upper management, they may lose faith in the leader's commitment to their success.

You may have the best intentions and fight for your team and still not be enough.

**Solution:** Regularly update the team on discussions with upper management and actively seek input on issues to bring forward.

### 5. Lack of technical competence in rapidly evolving fields

Managing technical teams is a tough job. You need to be a good leader AND have enough technical skills.

In fast-changing industries, a leader who doesn't keep up with technical developments may lose credibility and the team's trust in their decision-making abilities.

**Solution:** Commit to ongoing learning and be transparent about areas where you need to defer to team experts.
