<p>In team management, you can have all sorts of KPIs to measure and display how well your team is doing: productivity, lead time, bugs, … Tracking those metrics helps the team to identify problems early and improve. The only one that is missing is the actual mood and motivation of your team members. And I don’t need to tell you <a href="https://blog.teammood.com/en/2017/03/07/wellbeing-at-work-the-benefits-of-happiness-in-the-workplace.html">how important it is for the good of the project</a>!</p>

<p>That’s the reason why, a few years ago (in 2006 more precisely), <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html">Akinori SAKATA</a> invented the <strong>Niko Niko calendar</strong>, a.k.a. the smiley calendar or the happiness index.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-niko-niko-calendar">What is the Niko-niko calendar?</h2>

<p>The Niko-niko calendar is the application of a very important principle in Agile project management defined by american engineer and <a href="https://www.teammood.com/en/agile-retrospective-tools-ideas/">Agile</a> expert Tom Gilb:</p>

<p>“Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.”</p>

<p>The measure doesn’t have to be perfect nor precise. The objective is to quantify something that wasn’t.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/nikoniko-calendar.jpg" alt="Niko-Niko calendar" /></p>

<p>So, how does the Niko-niko calendar work? It’s a simple calendar with everybody’s name on it. At the end of the day, each team member is invited to share their mood of the day, sticking smilies happy 😄, straight 😬 or frowning 🙁 or color stickers on it. That’s actually where its name comes from: Niko means smile in Japanese.</p>

<p>The Niko-niko doesn’t provide an exact measure of the team’s mood, but it helps quantifying the well-being, morale and motivation – three factors that are usually difficult to measure.</p>

<p>The <a href="/2019/03/29/why-doing-team-health-checks.html">team’s spirit</a> is even more important for an Agile team as the success of the project relies on it. It’s the reason why the Niko-niko calendar was first invented for Agile teams. It provides a general view of how well the team is doing, and not just at individual level.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-niko-niko-method">How to use the Niko-niko method?</h2>

<p>The Niko-niko must follow some principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone’s mood should be visible to the others</li>
  <li>It should never be hold against someone or be considered as an individual objective</li>
  <li>The moods should be observed during the next day’s <a href="https://blog.teammood.com/2018/04/18/best-practices-to-run-effective-daily-standup-meetings.html">daily meeting</a>)</li>
  <li>The manager / team leader / scrum master should try to understand and treat “abnormality”, good or bad: a common bad day shared by the whole team, a person that is constantly happy while the rest of the team is unhappy and vice-versa, a general deterioration of the team’s mood, a shared “happy” mood even if the project isn’t good wel…</li>
</ul>

<p>In concrete terms, to use the Niko-niko method, you can build <a href="https://blog.teammood.com/niko-niko/diy/2013/05/07/build-your-own-niko-niko-calendar.html">your own Niko-niko calendar</a> with a daily calendar and a stack of color stickers. Or <a href="https://www.teammood.com/en/Niko-Niko/">choose to use an online tool</a> if your team is working remotely, or simply if you want to be able to analyze trends. An online tool can also help you gather comments more easily.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-leverage-the-niko-niko-calendar">How to leverage the Niko-niko calendar</h2>

<p>Don’t let your Niko-niko hang there for nothing! Quantifying your team’s mood is only the first step, you need to be able to act on it, where your team is in a good or bad mood.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.teammood.com/2018/05/16/your-team-is-in-a-bad-mood-heres-what-you-need-to-do.html">Reacting to one of several teammates’ bad mood</a> can seem pretty obvious: you don’t want a bad situation to degenerate, and you need your team to be at its best in order to deliver results. But <a href="https://blog.teammood.com/2018/06/12/how-to-leverage-your-teams-good-mood.html">understanding and leveraging your team’s good mood</a> is also very important.</p>

<p>Data from a Niko-niko calendar is a huge opportunity for reflection. You can get instant feedback from changes that are altering the work environment. It can also be included in a reporting for top management (leaving it anonymous).</p>
