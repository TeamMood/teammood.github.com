    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you search the Web for resources about entrepreneurship, (lean)startup and so on, you&#8217;ll find a lot of articles and advices, but it is very hard to know how to begin, and what&#8217;s could be your next move.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember how I get on this, but I found an awesome gold nugget : <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a></p>

<p><a href="http://startitup.co"><img class="center" src="http://blog.teammood.com/images/posts/startitup.png" title="" ></a></p>

<p>Based on the Lean Startup, it helps me lot with valuable advices, and a lot of articles containing several samples.</p>

<p>It is very simple to use : you go through the step by step guide, answer some questions about your idea/team/competition etcâ€¦ and it progressively builds your Lean Canvas and helps you to structure your mind.</p>

<p>Also note that these guys are expecting a lot of feedback, and they are super reactive.</p>

<p>So if you have an idea, and you don&#8217;t know where to start, go on <a href="http://startitup.co">StartitUp</a> !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At last, I finally &#8220;officially&#8221; launched the TeamMood project by using two announce ments through Twitter, this is the one in English (another one was made in French):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr"><p>Guys, I&#8217;m launching my first side-project !! <a href="http://t.co/9h4lyIIMtc" title="http://teammood.com">teammood.com</a>, feel free to share the love ;-) <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23teammood">#teammood</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23nikoniko">#nikoniko</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23happy">#happy</a></p>&mdash; Nicolas Deverge (@ndeverge) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndeverge/status/324860646296539136">18 avril 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://blog.teammood.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>So far so good, in just hour, I had 29 people who registred by giving their email for about 179 unique visitors.</p>

<p>And I also received many positive feedbacks from some people.</p>

<p>I think that my first MVP has quite a good result, so now, I have to keep on the adventure !!</p>

    <id>http://blog.teammood.com/blog/2013/03/31/the-idea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wanted to build a project of my own. On a daily basis, I give advices to IT companies about technologies, methodologies and strategies to build awesome products. And now it is my turn !</p>

<p>So I finally took the time to build my first side project: <a href="http://teammood.com" class="teammood">TeamMood</a> !</p>

<p><a href="http://teammood.com"><img class="center" src="http://blog.teammood.com/images/posts/coming-soon.png" title="" ></a></p>

<p>I will not explain what the project is about in this post, I prefer to let you discover the idea through the very first MVP which is a simple &#8221;<a href="http://teammood.com">coming soon</a>&#8221; page and let you give me a lot of <a href="mailto:hello@teammood.com">feedback</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the idea scratched me since many months because I feel that it can bring a lot in some companies that I work with. But it took me a lot of time before starting to build something, probably because I thought that if I begin to do this, I&#8217;d have to pull it to the end, ie some kind of commitment.</p>

<p>And yes, I use LeanStartup to explore the idea, because I don&#8217;t know if it will be a good one and if people will be interested. So let&#8217;s learn with this first MVP and we&#8217;ll see :-)</p>
