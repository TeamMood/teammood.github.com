<p>The technic is very easy: at the end of the day, each team member paste a sticker on a calendar to tell if he had a good day at work.

<p>In other word, you probably ever went back to home from work and feel that you had a bad day, or you did not feel ‚Äúproductive‚Äù. That‚Äôs a red sticker.</p>

<p>After some time, you‚Äôll see some color being dominant, it will give an insight of the mood of the team.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to take a look at the Niko-niko calendar during the <a href="https://www.teammood.com/en/agile-retrospective-tools-ideas/">Agile retrospective</a>.</p>

<p>It is not exact science, it is just a simple tool to get some <a href="/2019/03/29/why-doing-team-health-checks.html">more informations about the team</a>.</p>

<p>The Niko-niko calendar is also know as ‚Äúhappiness index‚Äù. Also note that ‚Äúniko‚Äù means ‚Äúsmile‚Äù in the japanese language.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Niko-niko calendar is from an <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/index_en.html" target="_blank">article from Akinori SAKATA in 2006</a>.</p>
