In any organization or team, one of the critical factors that can impact the overall productivity and success of the team is organization. 

Being organized can lead to better communication, more efficient processes, and a sense of calm and control over your work. 

But did you know that being organized can also improve your team's mood? In this blog post, we'll explore how being organized can boost your team's morale and overall happiness.

## Lowering stress
When things are disorganized, it can lead to a sense of chaos and overwhelm. This can be especially true in the workplace, where deadlines and projects are always looming. 

When a team is disorganized, it can lead to higher levels of stress, which can impact the mood and productivity of team members.

However, an organized team/individual can reduce stress levels and promote a sense of calm. When everything has its place and processes are streamlined, it can help team members feel more in control of their workloads.

For example, you can use an app like [Routine](https://www.routine.co/){: target="_blank"} to create a checklist for all the things that have not yet been organized and then work on ways to organize that list. 

When done by all team members, this simple activity can lead to a more positive and productive work environment where they can better know what is on their plate and focus on it.

According to a National Association of Professional Organizers [study](https://associationsnow.com/2015/01/professional-organizers-sort-impact-clutter/){: target="_blank"}, 82% of respondents felt less stressed after organizing their workspace. This shows that being organized can have a direct impact on reducing stress levels.

## Smoother communication

Clear communication is key to any successful team. However, when things are disorganized, it can lead to miscommunications and misunderstandings. 

For example, suppose files are scattered across different folders or platforms. In that case, it can be challenging to know where to find the latest version of a document or which team member is responsible for a particular task.

You can use tools like [Asana](https://asana.com/){: target="_blank"} or [Trello](https://trello.com/){: target="_blank"} to track responsibilities and a central hub like [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/){: target="_blank"} to manage information access and updates.

When a team is organized, communication is much smoother. 

With clear guidelines and streamlined processes in place, it's easier for team members to understand their roles and responsibilities. This can lead to more efficient communication and, ultimately, better results.

## Improved productivity

When a team is organized, it can lead to improved productivity levels, and this is because team members can focus on their tasks without worrying about the distraction of disorganization. 

For example, if a team member spends hours searching for a file or document, they are wasting valuable time that could have been spent on more productive tasks.

However, when everything is organized and easy to find, team members can get more done in less time. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, boosting team morale and overall happiness.

According to a [survey conducted by OfficeMax](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/OFFICEMAX-INC-11781/news/OFFICEMAX-INC-National-Survey-Reveals-Workplace-Clutter-Tarnishes-Professional-Image-and-May-Preve-13544953/){: target="_blank"}, 77% of respondents said that cluttered and disorganized workspaces negatively impacted their productivity levels. This indicates that having an organized workspace can boost productivity and, by extension, team morale.

## Promoting a sense of teamwork

When everyone works together towards a common goal, there should be clear guidelines and processes to ensure everyone is on the same page. 

When team members feel part of a cohesive unit, it can lead to greater job satisfaction and overall happiness. So make your processes, guidelines, and practices clear to your team members.

An organized team can foster this sense of cohesion and improve overall morale. According to a [study by Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it){: target="_blank"}, employees who feel like they are part of a cohesive team are more productive and engaged. 

## Encouraging innovation

Being organized can also promote innovation within your team. When everything is streamlined and processes are clear, team members can focus on developing new ideas and processes rather than spending their time on administrative tasks.

Encouraging innovation within your team can lead to a more positive and innovative workspace. When team members feel like they have the space and support to be creative, they can come up with new solutions to the team's challenges.

Innovation can also help to improve overall team morale. When team members are working on exciting new projects and seeing their ideas come to life, it can boost their satisfaction with their work and create a sense of pride within the team.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, being organized can significantly impact your team's overall mood and happiness. By reducing stress levels, improving communication, promoting a sense of teamwork, and encouraging innovation, an organized team can be much happier and more productive. 

Implementing clear guidelines and processes, streamlining workflows, and ensuring that everything has its place can lead to a more positive work environment and a more successful team.
