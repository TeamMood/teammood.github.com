  <!--More-->

  <p>So far so good, in just hour, I had 29 people who registred by giving their email for about 179 unique visitors.</p>

  <p>And I also received many positive feedbacks from some people.</p>

  <p>I think that my first MVP has quite a good result, so now, I have to keep on the adventure !!</p>
